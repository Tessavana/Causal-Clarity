"It relies on the idea that people react to unfair intentions by sacrificing a part of their payoffs in order to punish others, even when there are no reputation gains from doing so (Rabin 1993;Falk and Fischbacher 2006).	3	ssc"
"Because the approach of pausing first-order collective action for multiple punishment stages has been explored extensively by others and because situations that it may fail to mirror well strike us as common and important, we study higher-order punishment in a repeated play dilemma game with the constraint that the number of punishment stages not exceed the number of contribution stages by more than a factor of two.	2	ssc"
"Outside the laboratory, partner preferences and time constraints typically inhibit equal rates of interaction between group members, the result being that people (and other social animals) interact with some individuals more than others.	1	ssc"
"The absence of an end-game effect or of a negative time trend in these groups is remarkable and offers evidence that unobservable sanctions can have a long-term impact on cooperation.	2	ssc"
"The extent of individual cooperation tends to be higher among high-identifying individuals, either because they place greater value in the good itself (De Cremer & Van Vugt, in press;Kerr, 1996), because they have greater trust in the cooperative intentions of fellow group members (Brann & Foddy, 1987;Brewer & Kramer, 1986;Kramer & Brewer, 1984), or both.	1	ssc"

"Working together on a team-building task enhanced cooperative tendencies even with little or no financial incentive for performing the task.	3	ssc"
"For if such a 'high-trust' society were characterized by the existence of many separate groups producing public goods with negative externalities for each other, the overall result would likely be worse than would have been the case had trust been low.	2	ssc"
"Our result suggests that the selfish prediction is prone to deviations when the equilibrium results in unequal distributions of payoffs, and there are alternative outcomes that increase both equality and the payoff of the disadvantaged party.	2	ssc"

"When people do not know the victims and have little if any positive regard for them, their donation behavior may be influenced primarily by criteria that they apply independently of their feelings of sympathy or empathy.	2	ssc"
"As actors participate in the production of public goods, processes of social comparison may affect the decisions about the individual contributions as well as the endogenously changing structure of an underlying social network.	2	ssc"
"Since the same presentation of information was used in her experiment, significant positive effects of trust on group size was observed even in the experimental situation where only this minimal information about others' behavior was presented.	3	ssc"
"We predicted that in absence of a sanctioning system, people would show little support for a sanctioning system unless there is collective inefficiency, and that in presence of a sanctioning system, people would support the sanctioning system, irre-spective of the information people have concerning collective (in)efficiency.	2	ssc"
"If industries can relocate easily, then the level of pollution would depend on the country with the weakest environmental regulation.	2	ssc"
"It serves people's short-term self interest not to contribute to the establishment of an authority, but if none or only few group members cooperate there will be no authority in place to monitor the good, and therefore the good may fail to be provided.	2	ssc"
"More interesting, however, is that the Sanction × Options interaction effect showed that the sanction increased the collective outcomes only in the two options condition.	3	ssc"
"As Axelrod (1984) has noted, when discount rates increase the probability that a defecting strategy is optimal also increases.	3	ssc"
"Result 7: Take framing weakly reduces cooperation for men and weakly increase cooperation for women.	3	ssc"
"As one individual increases his or her effort, the personal payoff increases regardless of other individuals' actions (the left panel); however, as the aggregate effort of the other individuals increases, the payoff for that particular individual decreases (the right panel), more clearly demonstrating the negative externality.	3	ssc"
"In many social-game protocols, ranging from gift-exchange over ultimatum bargaining to public-good situations, human behaviour differs substantially from the Nash-equilibrium that results if we assume that players care only about their own monetary payoff.	3	ssc"
"These results suggest that the shared outcomes involved in cooperation did increase cohesiveness.	3	ssc"
"In two behavioral experiments, we offer individuals the latter possibility: Participants can work together to increase the total size of the pie and hence increase the size of their own slice.	2	ssc"
"The alternative model predicts the following predictions: P 1 : When there is no tax imposed, individual contributions will exceed 5. P 2 : When a tax of 3 is imposed, total individual contributions will exceed the individual contributions made when there is no tax imposed.	3	ssc"

"However, previous research showed that SVO, measured a substantial amount of time in advance, still affected behavior in the predicted ways (e.g., mcclintock & Allison, 1989).	3	ssc"
"The discrepant levels of attention paid to music in relation to consumer behavior and employee or organizational behavior are most clear when considering retail workspaces because (i) customers and employees cohabit the locations and (ii) it is reasonable to expect that music that is selected to influence the behaviors of customers would have similar influences on employees.	2	ssc"
""" 5 contexts lead actors to rely more on contributions to the group than competitive contexts, while competitive contexts lead actors to rely more on punishment of others than cooperative contexts.	3	ssc"
"Furthermore, the highest contributor in the group earned more prestige when the good was unattainable, suggesting an association between status and conspicuous cooperation (Hypothesis 3).	1	ssc"
"As a consequence, confounding effects such as reputation building through punishment or strategic reasons for punishing to increase cooperation in repeated interactions, as shown by Gächter et al. (2004) and Gächter and Herrmann (2009), can be excluded and a clear theoretical benchmark for standard preferences can be derived.	3	ssc"
