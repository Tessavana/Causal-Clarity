"As one individual increases his or her effort, the personal payoff increases regardless of other individuals' actions (the left panel); however, as the aggregate effort of the other individuals increases, the payoff for that particular individual decreases (the right panel), more clearly demonstrating the negative externality.	3	ssc"
"In many social-game protocols, ranging from gift-exchange over ultimatum bargaining to public-good situations, human behaviour differs substantially from the Nash-equilibrium that results if we assume that players care only about their own monetary payoff.	3	ssc"

"The discrepant levels of attention paid to music in relation to consumer behavior and employee or organizational behavior are most clear when considering retail workspaces because (i) customers and employees cohabit the locations and (ii) it is reasonable to expect that music that is selected to influence the behaviors of customers would have similar influences on employees.	2	ssc"
""" 5 contexts lead actors to rely more on contributions to the group than competitive contexts, while competitive contexts lead actors to rely more on punishment of others than cooperative contexts.	3	ssc"
"Furthermore, the highest contributor in the group earned more prestige when the good was unattainable, suggesting an association between status and conspicuous cooperation (Hypothesis 3).	1	ssc"
"As a consequence, confounding effects such as reputation building through punishment or strategic reasons for punishing to increase cooperation in repeated interactions, as shown by G‰chter et al.
