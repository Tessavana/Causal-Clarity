"In line with these predictions, Pellegrini & Long (2002) have observed an initial increase in aggressive competition as adolescents moved from primary to secondary school, and bullying behavior appeared to mediate dominance status during this transition.",1,Ssc
It was concluded that the high degree of competitiveness typically found in PD game studies may be largely a function of the isolation imposed on the subjects by the experimenter.,1,Ssc
"Historically, women have taken on peacekeeping roles in groups (De Groot & Peniston-Bird, 2000;Goldstein, 2003), perhaps because they are more concerned with preserving group harmony (Baumeister & Sommer, 1997;Geary, 1998).",1,Ssc
Both effects should cause increase in public-good provision at least at level 1.,1,Ssc
"However, on ratings of group performance, status and attitudinal similarity combined did lead to increased intergroup differentiation, again unaffected by goal relations.",1,Ssc
"This outcome suggests that if both the economic and the psychological contexts of decisions are carefully replicated, the laboratory can be used as an inexpensive way to test potential policy mechanisms.",1,Ssc
"First, the higher the payoff foregone by a freerider when not receiving rewards, the more likely he/she is to act (more) cooperatively in the social dilemma game in order to attract rewards.",1,Ssc
"Cooperative corporate culture can be nurtured by starting small, as Weber (2006)  shows experimentally with a coordination game.",1,Ssc
"The results of this study suggest that while it is true that people with an altruistic or cooperative orientation will participate more than those with an individualistic or competitive orientation, their participation is likely to be reduced if they observe other membersÕ defection behavior.",1,Ssc
"However, the non-monotonicity between observability and deterrence we observe is troubling, because it suggests that simply increasing the ability to monitor outside threats may not lead to better outcomes, and it leaves us unsure about what level of observability is required to generate better outcomes.",1,Ssc
The fothfun mechanism thus leads to less cooperation than in the baseline case with no punishment if the detrimental effect of retaliatory punishment is greater than the positive norm-enforcing effect of punishment.,1,Ssc
"The larger this bias, the stronger the effect of ignorance on norm compliance.",1,Ssc
"When players have the option of punishing each other after the contribution stage, the effect of the moral messages on contributions becomes persistent: punishments and moral messages interact to sustain cooperation.",1,Ssc
The consequence of these two evolutionary forces is that in equilibrium strong reciprocators and purely selfish humans coexist.,1,Ssc
"Thus, a leader who dislikes disadvantageous inequality would tend to opt for NEG as an incentive scheme.",1,Ssc

"ur pilot experiments indicated that the realized duration of games, especially in the early repeated games, had a substantial effect on the subjects' cooperation rates.",1,Ssc
"Consistent with our second hypothesis, which predicts that relationship duration mediates the impact of tie strength on cooperation, we find that both the main effect of tie value and its interaction with the number of tie swaps are diminished, relative to Model 2. The main effect decreases by 64% (from −.069 to −.025), and the interaction with the number of tie swaps decreases by 65% (from .029 to .01).",1,Ssc
"However, insiders cannot correct such free riding through directed punishment; indeed, the only option insiders have for hurting free-riding outsiders is to limit their contributions.",1,Ssc
"The maintenance of social norms often depends on external enforcement, as in the absence of credible sanctioning mechanisms prosocial behaviour deteriorates quickly.",1,Ssc
"This implies that conflict increases parochialism both by increasing preferences for in-group cooperation, and by decreasing preferences for out-group cooperation.",1,Ssc
"Secondly, the experience of conflict may create or deepen ingroup identity, strengthening other-regarding preferences toward in-group members and making it more attractive to cooperate within groups.",1,Ssc
"Selfish players may choose to reveal private information through costless and non-binding communication or cheap talk; such revelation can lead to efficiency gains, as shown by Crawford and Sobel (1982).",1,Ssc
"However, the experiment shows that communication causes cooperation to increase rapidly, reaching almost the social optimal amount of profits in some cases.",1,Ssc
"As actors participate in the production of public goods, processes of social comparison may affect the decisions about the individual contributions as well as the endogenously changing structure of an underlying social network.",1,Ssc
Subjects might have inferred from the capable-but-failing partner's behavior that he or she disvalued the task or the performance incentive.,1,Ssc
"Policies like the Pigouvian subsidy ignore these non-Nash behaviors, and the result is that inefficient under-extraction is exacerbated in our context.",1,Ssc

"In particular, in the S-treatment the anticipation of social reward and disapproval may become more salient in later periods leading to higher contributions in the final periods than under anonymity.",1,Ssc
"Nevertheless, individuals may form beliefs about who sanctioned them based on who sanctioned others, and may attempt to counter-punish based on this information.",1,Ssc
The original MGE had a strong effect because it involved allocation of tangible rewards; this implies that mere categorization produces discriminative behavior.,1,Ssc
""" 5 contexts lead actors to rely more on contributions to the group than competitive contexts, while competitive contexts lead actors to rely more on punishment of others than cooperative contexts.",1,Ssc
Our observation that angry subjects contribute less could be the result of a change in social preferences or a change in beliefs about the behaviour of others.,1,Ssc
"Further, because direct reciprocity was not possible in our experiments, sharing arrangements were not self-enforcing.",1,Ssc
"In the game, a leader usually emerged and the leader's pleadings for cooperation were harder to ignore because all the players had experienced the results of greedy play.",1,Ssc
"If there were no time value, then there would be no advantage to hiring an agent first (since the other party would respond by hiring an agent instantaneously), and therefore a prisoner's dilemma could not exist.",1,Ssc
We did not obtain saliva samples from two participants because these two participants were short-termly recruited and not screened in advance for health and smoking absence (final N = 58).,1,Ssc

"I felt proud of myself, because thanks to me my two friends talked, and solved their problem.",1,Ssc
"A possible transformation of material payoffs into an internal subjective game through the use of information about themselves, their group members, and the incentives of the repeated game may induce cooperative behaviour as a rational strategy in a collective-action setting.",1,Ssc
Our study tests why discounting a belief in free will increases the likelihood of uncooperative behavior.,1,Ssc
"Those with larger endowments realize that their contributions will make a larger impact in earning the public good, increasing their motivation to contribute.",1,Ssc

"Subjects who did not see the pool size drop tended to vote against the elimination of free access to the commons, whereas subjects who did see their pool size drop voted to relinquish free access.",1,Ssc
We use an experiment with multiple threshold public goods to show how increasing the number of public goods vying for funding can decrease both total contributions across all goods and the probability that any public good receives enough donations to succeed.,1,Ssc
"Thus, whereas at first sight guilt merely indicates the presence of a repentant transgressor, other group members may indirectly profit from this emotional display because it may lead third parties to evaluate them as prosocial.",1,Ssc

Previous research has shown that behavior aligns with self-interest only when self-interest is salient.,1,Ssc
"On one hand, these findings partially confirm our speculation vis-à-vis the role of risk taking: reciprocators were not necessarily cooperators under conditions of uncertainty, as some of them chose to cooperate because they could bear a high risk in anticipating the counterpart's goodwill.",1,Ssc
"In other words, acceptance would be more common if the subjects' expectations were met because, although a shared concept of fairness exists, fairness is sensitive to different factors (personal, situational, and social) that influence expectations and fairness perception.",1,Ssc
"The second insight is that the inefficiency observed in heterogeneous groups is not only due to the inefficiently low levels of contribution, but also due to a relative underuse of rewards.",1,Ssc
"Consistent with this tendency to operate according to personality type, many of the participants in my laboratory study were slow to change their behaviors when they were at low performing ranks.",1,Ssc
"An examination of histograms of scores for each condition suggests that people tended to lapse into either full cooperation or full defection in the no communication condition, which greatly increases the variance of the condition.",1,Ssc
"The results also reveal that the average harvest behavior in the baseline game positively and significantly affects the harvest behavior in the second game, suggesting some persistence of behavior over the two games.",1,Ssc
"As one individual increases his or her effort, the personal payoff increases regardless of other individuals' actions (the left panel); however, as the aggregate effort of the other individuals increases, the payoff for that particular individual decreases (the right panel), more clearly demonstrating the negative externality.",1,Ssc
"Given that tit for tat yielded greater outcomes than cooperative or noncooperative partners, and given that tit for tat has received considerable attention as a functional strategy, it is interesting to note that in social dilemmas in which locomotion is possible, tit for tat can do even better if this strategy is accompanied by locomotions to high interdependence rather than low interdependence.",1,Ssc
"Because of the partner design, this yields 18 independent observations for each treatment.",1,Ssc
"If participants in the simultaneous game play the zero contribution equilibrium with some positive probability, then the comparative static of the low-fixed-cost treatment should still hold.",1,Ssc
"However, there are also reasons to think that the treatment will lead to low contributions, since the reaction to the comprehension/advice combination may be defensive.",1,Ssc
"Although a principally exploitative relationship between owners and drivers does not necessarily improve intergroup relations, familiarity with intergroup economic ties may explain the lack of ethnic bias in the laboratory game.",1,Ssc
An important consequence of this increase in average effort is that the aggregate monetary payoff increases by 40% even if one takes the payoff reductions that result from actual punishments into account.,1,Ssc
"Otherwise, if the accumulated gain explains the behaviour of the birds but the one trial gain does not, then the birds are making decisions based on the four trial reward and are playing a mutualism game.",1,Ssc
"The public-goods literature finds that as groups increase in size individuals become more hesitant to cooperate and less able to coordinate actions (Franzen, 1995;Knez & Camerer, 1994).",1,Ssc
"They understood that rendering people interdependent, in the marketplace and elsewhere, increases the stakes they have in others' outcomes and thereby fosters the development of other-regarding motives.",1,Ssc
"As a random-pairings session continues, some of these first-round cooperators get discouraged, and shift to defecting in the first round.",1,Ssc
"The results of the present study constitute, in a way, a return to the idea that fairness judgments are not affected by dilemma type, although we now suggest that it is the presentation of decisions in the dilemma types that induces the focus.",1,Ssc
"Considering the relatively smaller groups (4 and 10 persons), they find that size only matters when the return on the public good is low, in which case, contributions actually increase in large groups.",1,Ssc
"Berkowitz (1960) has demonstrated that unexpected frustrations produce more hostility than expected frustrations and, what is more important for the study reported here, that subjects who expect hostility and receive friendliness will reveal a greater trend toward friendliness than those subjects who have a reason to expect friendliness.",1,Ssc
"Large coalitions mean few outsiders but, at the same time, high free-rider benefits if the coalition members fully internalize their mutual benefits.",1,Ssc
"II it was predicted that Ss would exploit an egotistical opponent to a greater extent when future interaction was anticipated than when it was not, but that when the opponent was seen to be self-effacing Lhe reverse would be true.",1,Ssc
Despite the interesting balance of incentives provided by introducing competition in the workplace -on one hand individual workers may exert more effort to win promotion or make more money while on the other overall production might suffer because of the lack of cooperation among workers -there has been remarkably little empirical work estimating the effect of competition on workplace cooperation.,1,Ssc
"Hence, it is attractive not to purchase a TV-license, but if too many do so, the good may not be provided at all.",1,Ssc
"In addition, results from the laboratory experiments reveal that subjects donate less when they are aware that an individual could have announced support but chose not to do so.",1,Ssc
"Specifically, when anticipated barriers lower the probability of successfully achieving one's interests, individuals should be more inclined to opt for the benefits of competitive actions.",1,Ssc
These results suggest that the shared outcomes involved in cooperation did increase cohesiveness.,1,Ssc
