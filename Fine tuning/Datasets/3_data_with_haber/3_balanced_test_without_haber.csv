The gains or losses incurred by the players on each trial are dependent on choices made by both of them between two available behaviors.,3,ssc
"Both the Outcome for Others and the Equality of Outcomes depend on others, meaning when the total group is greater than two people, these others' properties are combinations of multiple people's behaviors, not just a single individual's behavior.",1,ssc
"Thus, because an elected leader refl ects the choice of the group and its members, an elected leader will feel strong support from the followers who will bestow on the leader a high sense of social responsibility ( Julian, Hollander, & Regula, 1969;Kenney et al., 1996).",3,ssc

"When the objective incentives remain identical, these studies showed that framing the dilemma in terms of ""taking from"" instead of ""contributing to"" increases cooperation (Brewer and Kramer, 1986).",3,ssc
"The institutional mechanism implemented in Study 1 is richer than an ultimatum game and simultaneously changes the incentive structure depending on the priors of the participants: if players believe that others will contribute at levels just above the lowest current contributor, and believe that others believe this, pure self-interest will generate the observed ratchet pattern.",3,ssc
