"Individually rational and selfish behavior thus leads to Pareto-suboptimal outcomes, rendering the one-shot PD a classic example of a social dilemma [1,2].",3,ssc
"As actors participate in the production of public goods, processes of social comparison may affect the decisions about the individual contributions as well as the endogenously changing structure of an underlying social network.",2,ssc
Results demonstrate that awareness tools providing information about highly cooperative group members encourage participants to trust one another and minimize the risk of being exploited.,3,ssc

People who sacrifice on behalf of others like themselves are more prone to the self-interest illusion because they see the benefits as going to people who are like themselves in some salient way.,3,ssc
A natural explanation for the limited capability of a leader's signal to influence followers' beliefs under heterogeneity is the lack of followers' trust in the relevance of the signal to participants who do not share the religion of the leader.,3,ssc

The discrepant levels of attention paid to music in relation to consumer behavior and employee or organizational behavior are most clear when considering retail workspaces because (i) customers and employees cohabit the locations and (ii) it is reasonable to expect that music that is selected to influence the behaviors of customers would have similar influences on employees.,2,ssc
"In other words, those subjects who showed a greater parochialism effect for contributing showed a greater self-interest illusion when the gain for their group was a loss for the other group.",3,ssc
Working together on a team-building task enhanced cooperative tendencies even with little or no financial incentive for performing the task.,3,ssc
"Therefore, if the attribution of intentions turns out to be behaviorally important, the ""consequentialism"" inherent in standard utility models is also in doubt.",3,ssc
There is some experimental evidence that groups are better off when punishment is delivered by a central agency than when group members sanction each other (O'GORMAN et al. 2009).,1,ssc
This result suggests that language activates group norms in a heterogeneous fashion: if different people's latent identities differ they can respond in very different ways to identical linguistic cues.,1,ssc
"The second insight is that the inefficiency observed in heterogeneous groups is not only due to the inefficiently low levels of contribution, but also due to a relative underuse of rewards.",3,ssc
"Of primary interest in this context is the latter interaction: block-ofrcd subjects who had participated first in the Paddle Game declined less in cooperativeness than those who had not, and tit-for-tat subjects with prior Paddle Game experience increased more in cooperativeness over trials than those without such experience.",3,ssc
This allowed them to condition their minimum proposal on the size of the coalition such that the internalization ratios a(k) may depend on the coalition size.,2,ssc
"Secondly, the experience of conflict may create or deepen ingroup identity, strengthening other-regarding preferences toward in-group members and making it more attractive to cooperate within groups.",2,ssc
"Our broad conclusion is that, while social desirability matters, the way it matters subtly depends on the social desirability personality type, and this in turn affects the social and experimental perceptions of what is demanded.",3,ssc
"This implies that conflict increases parochialism both by increasing preferences for in-group cooperation, and by decreasing preferences for out-group cooperation.",3,ssc
The consequence of these two evolutionary forces is that in equilibrium strong reciprocators and purely selfish humans coexist.,1,ssc
"In models based on income differences, if responders care for the utility of the other responder, then in addition to receiving disutility because the take authority has a higher income than they do, they will also receive disutility because the take authority has higher income than their friend does.",3,ssc
"We found that when people's mortality was not called to their attention, a need-focused appeal had more influence on their donation decisions than a bandwagon appeal.",3,ssc
"For the present purposes, we opted against counterbalancing, due to the demands that this would have placed on the number of different sequential arrangements, as well as a balanced distribution of young and old girls and boys.",3,ssc
An idealistically cooperative voice raised in a context that does not offer substantive advantages for cooperation may not be persuasive.,2,ssc
Sequential contributions decrease to the predicted equilibrium level and fall below the greater-than-expected contributions in the simultaneous game.,3,ssc
We argue and show that an important reason why people apply the do-no-harm principle to their use of sanctions is because they feel personally responsible for the harm done.,3,ssc
These results suggest that the shared outcomes involved in cooperation did increase cohesiveness.,2,ssc
"Specifically, when anticipated barriers lower the probability of successfully achieving one's interests, individuals should be more inclined to opt for the benefits of competitive actions.",2,ssc
The binary-choice is used because there is no a priori way of determining whether a second decider will interpret a given level of cooperation by the first decider in the continuous cooperation/sequential version as 'cooperative' or 'non-cooperative'.,1,ssc
"In the case of defaults, an endowment effect may be at work: people may perceive the default option as something they possess and, thus, place more value on it.",2,ssc
Attributing human character- istics and motivations to nonhuman agents increases the ability to make sense of an agent's action and reduces uncertainty.,3,ssc
"Berkowitz (1960) has demonstrated that unexpected frustrations produce more hostility than expected frustrations and, what is more important for the study reported here, that subjects who expect hostility and receive friendliness will reveal a greater trend toward friendliness than those subjects who have a reason to expect friendliness.",3,ssc
"The increase in average contributions for the US region in RN (29.8) relative to ON (26.7) is due to the fact that, in ON, 64% of American participants opted for the principles of future polluter-pays and equal percentage reduction of current  emissions, both of which are synonymous with the smallest public good contribution; conversely, in RN, 62% of Chinese participants selected the principles of equal per capita entitlement to emissions and historical polluter-pays, the equity principles that denote the largest contributions for the US region.",3,ssc
"In other words, a dictator is more likely to make a fair offer if he/she expects the audience to observe their choice.",1,ssc

"As a random-pairings session continues, some of these first-round cooperators get discouraged, and shift to defecting in the first round.",3,ssc
"However, if each individual attempts to maximize his or her self-interest, the collective outcome will be less desirable than if each individual attempts to maximize the collective interest (Dawes, 1980).",2,ssc
"While the behavior of subjects in the low-reward conditions is more ambiguous, it is congruent with the speculation that persons are not highly motivated to do well in the PD game when earnings are small, irrespective of the extent to which the rewards are equitable.",3,ssc
"It may well be that if a group fails in establishing the public good, a self-sacrificing leader may be evaluated as poor since his or her efforts did not prevent the group from failing.",2,ssc
"Although punishment may be used to regulate the members of the in-group, the evidence presented here suggests that it is often driven by intergroup biasleading to harsher punishment of out-group members.",2,ssc
The original MGE had a strong effect because it involved allocation of tangible rewards; this implies that mere categorization produces discriminative behavior.,3,ssc
"Clearly, the salience of social categories may be important in order to create cooperation within groups (e.g.",2,ssc
People may voluntarily contribute to a public good because they feel morally obligated to assist others in a common cause or because they realize that contributing will help the group as a whole.,2,ssc
Subjects' reaction to punishment suggests that earnings feedback affects negatively their expectations about the contribution of their peers in the following period.,2,ssc
This unpredicted interaction may have happened due to collectiveness created by the community title.,2,ssc
But since the payoff for mutual defection is smaller than the payoff for mutual cooperation (fwo) the dilemma arises on what to choose if having in mind also the welfare of the society and not just personal interests.,2,ssc
