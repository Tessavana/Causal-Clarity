We also find that the level of contribution under different default options is sensitive to the type of the public goods game employed.,2,ssc
If all participants adopt the strategy of never using the bus then they will each receive an earning of £25.,2,ssc
Our results show that social ties between group members influence both cooperation and norm enforcement -creating substantial differences between M G and SG.,1,ssc
Attributing human character- istics and motivations to nonhuman agents increases the ability to make sense of an agent's action and reduces uncertainty.,3,ssc
"I felt proud of myself, because thanks to me my two friends talked, and solved their problem.",3,ssc
These simulation results thus lend support to our claim that the strength of ties between actors can contribute to the evolution of cooperation in dynamic networks.,2,ssc
Result 3. The threat of inter-period feuds in LF reduces the frequency of altruistic punishment relative to the Baseline treatment.,3,ssc
"The intuition is that in that case there always exist strategy combinations in which a single (pivotal) player's investment in monitoring causes an increase of the MPCR above 1, transferring the public into a private good and making the investment profitable and, as a consequence, making positive investments in monitoring individually rational.",3,ssc
"When players have the option of punishing each other after the contribution stage, the effect of the moral messages on contributions becomes persistent: punishments and moral messages interact to sustain cooperation.",2,ssc
"The greater are others' contributions, the less is one rewarded, ceteris paribus -perhaps because there is little scope for either punishing or rewarding in groups in which all are contributing close to the maximum.",3,ssc
"Individual-scale variables like wealth and education may affect the costs of public goods provisioning or the benefits of short-term defection, and so wealthier and more educated individuals who can obtain resources more readily can expect to be more generous.",2,ssc
The point we try to make is that trust is relatively less important in the AG compared to the PG because the removal of the temptation to free ride in the former strengthens incentives to cooperate.,3,ssc
"Second, the absence of an effect of Openness might also be driven by statistical reasons, due to the structure of the MPT model: Parameter e is defined conditional on non-selfish behavior, which leads to fewer trials per person (and hence a lower statistical efficiency) for the estimation of parameter e than for parameter s.",3,ssc
"Based on the above reasoning, we predicted that individuals who anticipate pride about acting fairly would be more likely to divide resources between themselves and another in a fair way, whereas those who anticipate regret about acting fairly would be less likely to do so.",1,ssc
"In fact, a recent agent-based simulation also suggests that gossip-based partner selection increases cooperation, whereas the strategy to defect after knowing about free riders' reputation decreases cooperation 18 .",1,ssc
This allowed them to condition their minimum proposal on the size of the coalition such that the internalization ratios a(k) may depend on the coalition size.,2,ssc
"Research on legitimacy of authorities has shown that perceived legitimacy, in particular a shared sense of legitimacy, creates voluntary compliance with norms (ZELDITCH and WALKER 1984;TYLER 1997).",3,ssc
"That is, when there is no noise, there is an increase in cooperation over successive interactions (at least in the context of TFT and TFT ϩ 1 strategies).",3,ssc
"In both the minimum-effort game and the public goods game, social interaction implies that subjects' choices of numbers or contributions, respectively, are affected by the choices of their neighbors.",1,ssc
"In a simultaneous PGD, risk-averse prosocials defect more than risk-seeking prosocials do because risk-averse prosocials are more worried about losing their endowments than their risk-seeking counterparts.",3,ssc
"However, previous research showed that SVO, measured a substantial amount of time in advance, still affected behavior in the predicted ways (e.g., mcclintock & Allison, 1989).",3,ssc
"Thus, we compare people who hold the evoked identity to people who are familiar with, but who do not hold, that identity: if identity is important in the current effects, those who do not hold the evoked identity will not be affected by identity-salience manipulations.",2,ssc
"For the present purposes, we opted against counterbalancing, due to the demands that this would have placed on the number of different sequential arrangements, as well as a balanced distribution of young and old girls and boys.",3,ssc

"In 2001, the Court ruled in United States v. United Foods, Inc. the mushroom checkoff program unconstitutional because it was a stand-alone checkoff advertising program and not part of a broader set of economic regulations.",3,ssc
A natural explanation for the limited capability of a leader's signal to influence followers' beliefs under heterogeneity is the lack of followers' trust in the relevance of the signal to participants who do not share the religion of the leader.,3,ssc
Ambiguity arises when a decision-maker finds it difficult or impossible to assign a subjective probability to an event.,1,ssc
"Windfall gains (e.g., winning the lottery) may lead to greater altruism, but wealth attained through participation in a market economy may not, since as Melvin Lerner and James Meindl (1981:219) note, ""coming to the aid of a person in need and sensitivity to their deservingness will occur if such responsiveness does not pose a threat to the actor's own deservingness.""",2,ssc
"Similarly, providing feedback on how one's energy use compares with one's neighbors had reduced consumption among American liberals but may have had the opposite effect among conservatives (80).",2,ssc
"Consider Pruitt and Kimmel's (1977) goal/expectation theory, which states that cooperation is more likely when trust is enhanced, but only if people also have a prosocial orientation (the goal to achieve mutual cooperation), if the trust explanation is true, then people with a prosocial orientation should contribute more when group identity is salient.",2,ssc
"In addition, results from the laboratory experiments reveal that subjects donate less when they are aware that an individual could have announced support but chose not to do so.",2,ssc
Threat was introduced by providing one or both subjects with a salient punitive capability in the form of a gate which could be closed by one subject to prevent access to the one-lane road.,2,ssc

Violent media may cause viewers to perceive greater anger and less gratitude during a cooperative task and as such be less inclined to cooperate.,2,ssc
"Our result suggests that the selfish prediction is prone to deviations when the equilibrium results in unequal distributions of payoffs, and there are alternative outcomes that increase both equality and the payoff of the disadvantaged party.",2,ssc
"We find that conflict increases cooperation within groups, while decreasing cooperation between groups.",3,ssc
"Our broad conclusion is that, while social desirability matters, the way it matters subtly depends on the social desirability personality type, and this in turn affects the social and experimental perceptions of what is demanded.",3,ssc
People may voluntarily contribute to a public good because they feel morally obligated to assist others in a common cause or because they realize that contributing will help the group as a whole.,2,ssc
"Second, it was concluded that highly threatening situations minimize the effects of idiosyncratic motives, perhaps arousing a common defensive motive.",3,ssc
One possible reason for the difference between these two studies is that learning effects are more likely to overwhelm the effects of pair IQ in longer games; this may be related to the finding that worker IQ is a stronger predictor of performance in the early months on a new job while IQ's predictive power for worker performance weakens after years spent in the same job (Hunt 1995).,1,ssc
"Thus, threats to a group generate increased solidarity (ee + ) within the threatened group, but also hostility (ee − ) against an opponent [72][73][74][75].",3,ssc
"Of primary interest in this context is the latter interaction: block-ofrcd subjects who had participated first in the Paddle Game declined less in cooperativeness than those who had not, and tit-for-tat subjects with prior Paddle Game experience increased more in cooperativeness over trials than those without such experience.",3,ssc

"Potlatches and other excessive public charitable displays suddenly begin to make sense when they are viewed as selfpresentation strategies (default, 1992).",1,ssc
Result 3. The choice of receiving feedback about individual earnings rather than about individual contributions is associated with a decrease in one's contribution in the next period.,1,ssc
"More specifically, participants influenced by a charismatic leader (i.e., high in self-sacrifice) were found to contribute more money to a charity fund, and this pattern was mediated by perceptions of charisma.",3,ssc
competitive individual) task led to less persistence on a subsequent task.,3,ssc
There is some experimental evidence that groups are better off when punishment is delivered by a central agency than when group members sanction each other (O'GORMAN et al. 2009).,1,ssc
"The alternative model predicts the following predictions: P 1 : When there is no tax imposed, individual contributions will exceed 5. P 2 : When a tax of 3 is imposed, total individual contributions will exceed the individual contributions made when there is no tax imposed.",3,ssc
Despite the interesting balance of incentives provided by introducing competition in the workplace -on one hand individual workers may exert more effort to win promotion or make more money while on the other overall production might suffer because of the lack of cooperation among workers -there has been remarkably little empirical work estimating the effect of competition on workplace cooperation.,2,ssc
"In this paper, we neither attribute behavioral differences between the 'elite' and the rest of society to endowment differences nor to self selection (a positive correlation between selfishness and endowment); rather we hypothesize in line with Cote et al. (2015) and Heap et al. (2016) that the inequality in the society itself makes elite members more selfish and less generous.",2,ssc
"Observed individual differences in the resting cortisol levels and social memory performance under the social stress condition may be due to individual differences in HPA reactivity, personality traits, and the level of GR/MR expression in the hippocampus [10].",1,ssc
5. Stability: Groups may be more stable when entry is restricted compared to the other two conditions if subjects are able to generate cooperation.,2,ssc
"Previous research indicates that people who strongly identified with the in-group are more competitive toward the out-group (e.g., Chase, 1992).",2,ssc
"Therefore, if the attribution of intentions turns out to be behaviorally important, the ""consequentialism"" inherent in standard utility models is also in doubt.",3,ssc
"Identifying the strategy employed by players engaged in an IPD could also have wider implications for understanding the determinants of social conflicts in general, and help to design effective methods for ameliorating these problems.",1,ssc
"Individually rational and selfish behavior thus leads to Pareto-suboptimal outcomes, rendering the one-shot PD a classic example of a social dilemma [1,2].",3,ssc
"As one individual increases his or her effort, the personal payoff increases regardless of other individuals' actions (the left panel); however, as the aggregate effort of the other individuals increases, the payoff for that particular individual decreases (the right panel), more clearly demonstrating the negative externality.",3,ssc
"We found that communication still improves group performance even with increased difficulties in communication and limited information about the resource, but the level of benefit for having communication is reduced.",3,ssc
"The similarity between single-player and multi-player versions of the IPD can provide a powerful research model as the reduction from two to one players reduces the number of uncontrolled and interacting variables involved in the prisoner's dilemma (Fantino, 2004).",2,ssc
"If industries can relocate easily, then the level of pollution would depend on the country with the weakest environmental regulation.",3,ssc
"The 'degree of imperfection' of this information clearly increases with the size of the group, because it becomes increasingly difficult to decompose the responses of other subjects into their reactions to the simultaneous changes in the contributions of their counterparts.",2,ssc
"This leads to a 'fairness' scenario in which the wealth of richer subjects is invested in their local network, allowing poorer neighbours to gain wealth.",3,ssc
"Alternately (or additionally) she may value the public good or charity itself and, believing that contribution levels are strategic complements, give more to influence others to give more.",2,ssc
"Similarly, a pro-social subject (again defined by his decisions in the experimental choice set) would tend to make slower selfish decisions and faster pro-social decisions.",1,ssc
"Policies like the Pigouvian subsidy ignore these non-Nash behaviors, and the result is that inefficient under-extraction is exacerbated in our context.",3,ssc
"A second and related implication is that when the CPR range ␤ Ϫ ␣ increases beyond a certain threshold, the individual requests will increase too.",3,ssc
"Since the same presentation of information was used in her experiment, significant positive effects of trust on group size was observed even in the experimental situation where only this minimal information about others' behavior was presented.",3,ssc
Our studies suggest that sometimes coordination can be easily promoted by simply pointing out to people that certain information is available to all people involved.,2,ssc
"Through such mechanisms, a deliberation treatment might increase cooperation in the second stage of a sequential prisoner's dilemma, contrary to the prediction of the SHH.",2,ssc
"As is argued in the literature, the effects of these punishments are clear: cooperation is established and maintained Sefton, Shupp & Walker (2002).",3,ssc
"It serves people's short-term self interest not to contribute to the establishment of an authority, but if none or only few group members cooperate there will be no authority in place to monitor the good, and therefore the good may fail to be provided.",2,ssc
"This is to be expected given the plausible assumption that the moralistic punishment by the partners had served to increase participants' willingness to cooperate in Experiments 1 and 2 (consistent with Fehr & Gächter, 2002).",2,ssc
"Gaining from the public good provided by their group, subjects increased their initial budget of 200 Rs by 59%.",3,ssc
The refined approach builds on key tenets of social identity theory to argue that identity affects cooperation by leadings actors to maximize ingroup outcomes and minimize ingroup inequalities.,3,ssc
"If the goal-transformation hypothesis is correct, then the behavior of proselfs should be affected more strongly by the type of identity that is salient (personal vs. group).",3,ssc
"The results of these groups show a crystal-clear picture: Participants overwhelmingly elected the best candidate in the absence of conflicts, but once competitive ''bribes'' were introduced, knowledge-sharing broke down, and the groups failed to pool information and to uncover the objectively best candidate, so an inferior candidate was elected in more than 80% of these elections.",3,ssc
"Threat of revenge induce more deliberation on punishment and reduces other perverse punishment, which will have a positive impact on cooperation.",3,ssc
Hypothesis 2: The presence of a threshold constraining participants' activities will lead participants to be less holistic in their cognitive orientations than when a threshold is not present.,3,ssc
"If imperfect information reduces the incentive to match others' contributions, both the matching rates of actors with relatively high marginal benefit functions and those with relatively low marginal benefit functions will tend to fall.",1,ssc
The upshot of these comments is that large churches as well as small churches must create a sense of belonging if they are to mitigate members' free riding tendencies and survive.,3,ssc
The binary-choice is used because there is no a priori way of determining whether a second decider will interpret a given level of cooperation by the first decider in the continuous cooperation/sequential version as 'cooperative' or 'non-cooperative'.,2,ssc
Both effects should cause increase in public-good provision at least at level 1.,2,ssc
The absence of an end-game effect or of a negative time trend in these groups is remarkable and offers evidence that unobservable sanctions can have a long-term impact on cooperation.,2,ssc
"The very existence of a government that can promulgate and enforce regulations to deter free riding while acting as a faithful agent of its citizens depends on voluntary pro-social acts such as citizen scrutiny of politicians' actions, self-education about political issues, and making the effort to vote in elections.",2,ssc
"Thus, they understand that they need to cooperate among themselves if they want to earn money.",1,ssc
"However, we have to recognize that as the subjective probabilities go to zero, the economic impact of choices becomes weak.",3,ssc
"In other words, acceptance would be more common if the subjects' expectations were met because, although a shared concept of fairness exists, fairness is sensitive to different factors (personal, situational, and social) that influence expectations and fairness perception.",1,ssc
This equilibrium arises because with more than one person contributing at least one contribution is wasted because that second person would be better off by not contributing.,2,ssc
It is therefore possible that the higher rates of cooperation in PD are (partly) due to the smaller size of the action set.,1,ssc
When designing emotional agents we have shown how the addition of mood can be used to enhance the decision-making aspect of that agent.,3,ssc
"Further, because direct reciprocity was not possible in our experiments, sharing arrangements were not self-enforcing.",3,ssc
Previous research has shown that behavior aligns with self-interest only when self-interest is salient.,2,ssc
"On one hand, these findings partially confirm our speculation vis-à-vis the role of risk taking: reciprocators were not necessarily cooperators under conditions of uncertainty, as some of them chose to cooperate because they could bear a high risk in anticipating the counterpart's goodwill.",3,ssc
The discrepant levels of attention paid to music in relation to consumer behavior and employee or organizational behavior are most clear when considering retail workspaces because (i) customers and employees cohabit the locations and (ii) it is reasonable to expect that music that is selected to influence the behaviors of customers would have similar influences on employees.,2,ssc
"As actors participate in the production of public goods, processes of social comparison may affect the decisions about the individual contributions as well as the endogenously changing structure of an underlying social network.",2,ssc
"The individual -group discontinuity effect entails that in mixed-motive situations, such as the Prisoner's Dilemma game (PDG), intergroup interactions are more competitive than inter-individual interactions.",2,ssc
"Because the approach of pausing first-order collective action for multiple punishment stages has been explored extensively by others and because situations that it may fail to mirror well strike us as common and important, we study higher-order punishment in a repeated play dilemma game with the constraint that the number of punishment stages not exceed the number of contribution stages by more than a factor of two.",2,ssc
The mutuality of the response improves the prognosis for the couple's staying together.,3,ssc
Results show that tax publicity reduces both the number of evaders and the amount of tax evaded.,3,ssc
"Taken together, our results illustrate the importance of equality as a normative criterion and how the efficacy of communication is reduced in the presence of normative conflict.",3,ssc
"This is because probability theory will predict that individuals will not allocate higher weight to any particular numbers, because the probability of winning should be the same for all numbers.",1,ssc
"Specifically, with the addition of the G allele on rs237887, self-reported positive emotional reactions significantly decreased (see Figure 1).",3,ssc
"The results of the present study constitute, in a way, a return to the idea that fairness judgments are not affected by dilemma type, although we now suggest that it is the presentation of decisions in the dilemma types that induces the focus.",1,ssc
There are indications that the unequal range of pay-off accelerated the observed trends rather than reversing them.,1,ssc
"The significant positive coefficient of Negative deviation of j in the first two regressions reveals that the greater the extent of free riding is, the greater is the likelihood and severity of altruistic punishment in the Baseline treatment.",3,ssc
"Because the cooperate-cooperate outcome produces more wealth than any other, optional entry will increase social welfare.",3,ssc
"The increase in average contributions for the US region in RN (29.8) relative to ON (26.7) is due to the fact that, in ON, 64% of American participants opted for the principles of future polluter-pays and equal percentage reduction of current  emissions, both of which are synonymous with the smallest public good contribution; conversely, in RN, 62% of Chinese participants selected the principles of equal per capita entitlement to emissions and historical polluter-pays, the equity principles that denote the largest contributions for the US region.",3,ssc
"When there is no privately provided public good, subjects can cooperate only through paying taxes.",3,ssc
Tokens kept have a private value while tokens invested in the public fund generate a 'public good' return by transferring income to the contributor and the rest of the players.,3,ssc
"Thus, representatives successfully advanced the interests of their constituencies when bargaining with persons who did not have constituencies of their own.",3,ssc
"However, if each individual attempts to maximize his or her self-interest, the collective outcome will be less desirable than if each individual attempts to maximize the collective interest (Dawes, 1980).",2,ssc
Liebrand et al. (1986) concluded that cooperators may place a higher value than individualists on how well an interaction satisfies personal or social behavioral standards.,2,ssc
This unpredicted interaction may have happened due to collectiveness created by the community title.,2,ssc
These results suggest that the shared outcomes involved in cooperation did increase cohesiveness.,2,ssc
Result 7: Take framing weakly reduces cooperation for men and weakly increase cooperation for women.,3,ssc
"Because participants generally cooperate withand rarely defect againstcooperators in the iterated PDG, the resulting distribution of the number of rounds participants cooperate tends to be severely non-normal.",2,ssc
"Depending on the parametrization, this new game can have egalitarian equilibria as well as asymmetric solutions, leaving one player worse off.",2,ssc
"Thus, a leader who dislikes disadvantageous inequality would tend to opt for NEG as an incentive scheme.",1,ssc
The paying taxes label should then lead to contributions comparable to those participants who do not spontaneously associate the public goods game with teamwork.,3,ssc
"For example, past research has shown that individual differences in social value orientation (SVO), a measure of concern for both self and others outcomes in interdependent social interactions (Messick & mcclintock, 1968), is able to predict contribution to public goods (e.g., Stouten, De Cremer, & Van Dijk, 2005. cf. Parks, 1994), even when defection is objectively the most economical course of action (Komorita & Parks, 1996).",1,ssc
"A decrease over time is consistent with game-theoretical predictions about conditional cooperation, since individuals are expected to eventually modify their behavior over time to maximize their earnings.",3,ssc
"Collectively, these informal sanctions provide a powerful mechanism for guiding social behavior.",3,ssc
"More specifically, the MCL may be higher in the VCM with real-time contributions simply because people tend to contribute more when they are observed, even if the observers' actions are not affected by this monitoring.",2,ssc
"The extent of individual cooperation tends to be higher among high-identifying individuals, either because they place greater value in the good itself (De Cremer & Van Vugt, in press;Kerr, 1996), because they have greater trust in the cooperative intentions of fellow group members (Brann & Foddy, 1987;Brewer & Kramer, 1986;Kramer & Brewer, 1984), or both.",1,ssc
Punishment is generally lower when the target was the highest contributor in the group and this effect is stronger for actual than for requested punishment.,3,ssc
"Our results show that emotion-regulation knowledge is itself neither positive nor negative, but can facilitate the objectives of individuals whose interests are in doing harm as well as those interested in benefiting the greater good.",2,ssc
"More interesting, however, is that the Sanction × Options interaction effect showed that the sanction increased the collective outcomes only in the two options condition.",3,ssc
This improves the earnings for those groups but the lowest earnings are not too different and this pulls the overall average earnings down to look more similar across treatments.,3,ssc
"In our study, by perceiving the punishment executer to be human, we show that such a rule could emerge spontaneously because the rule benefits the punishment executers themselves.",3,ssc
"Hence, it is attractive not to purchase a TV-license, but if too many do so, the good may not be provided at all.",2,ssc
"Subjects who did not see the pool size drop tended to vote against the elimination of free access to the commons, whereas subjects who did see their pool size drop voted to relinquish free access.",2,ssc
"Namely, at the end of a repeated public good contribution game, if a surprise announcement is made that the same group of subjects will play another repeated game, contributions initially jump back to a relatively high level and then decrease again over time.",2,ssc
"In sum, the content analysis of communication provides further evidence that conflict expenditures in OPEN are lower than in the other treatments because subjects discuss and successfully implement turn taking behavior between groups.",3,ssc
The results show that cooperation was higher when people could leave bad partners versus when they could not.,2,ssc
"The group's average contribution across periods 1-16 (""Contribution P1-16"") has a significantly positive impact on the probability of appointing a leader in period 17 and in period 21.",3,ssc
"Nonetheless, we feel that it is worthwhile showing that the extra step of instrumenting for received messages does not affect our main conclusion: there is a causal relationship between receiving an explicit threat and cheating on collusive agreements.",3,ssc
"If the memory advantage for expectancy-incongruent information is abolished under cognitive load, our ability to successfully engage in social cooperation would be impaired because this type of memory is essential for correcting maladaptive behavior tendencies.",2,ssc
They produce evidence to support the notion that a greater MPCR distance increases contribution by making the gains from cooperation in the social dilemma more salient for all group members. 18,3,ssc
"This impression was reinforced by pair-wise comparisons indicating that participants who underwent the TÀ treatment on study day 1, and who showed relatively reduced number of cooperative responses, significantly increased their cooperative responses after the T + treatment on study day 2, while participants who underwent the T + treatment on day 1 showed similarly high levels of cooperation on day 2.",3,ssc
"The larger this bias, the stronger the effect of ignorance on norm compliance.",3,ssc
"These 2 features make Jan and Marcia socially interdependent, and the rank order of outcomes available to each of them will constitute a Prisoner's Dilemma.",3,ssc
"Consequently, the payoffs of free-riders in SFI decrease and over the periods, participants in SFI experience the typically observed collapse of cooperation in repeated social dilemma interactions (Fig. 1).",3,ssc
My understanding of people's ideas about cooperation in Kamchatka was significantly enhanced by the opportunity to refer back to the game when explaining my thoughts and posing my questions.,1,ssc
"The present findings complement this growing literature by showing that people are actually willing to forgive an incident of noise, as long as the partner communicates about noise and clarifies the actual (benign) intentions.",2,ssc
The groups convened in separate adjacent classrooms to prevent communication between groups.,3,ssc
Allowing individuals to punish their peers for socially bad behavior can improve cooperation in groups and sometimes allow them to achieve more efficient outcomes in social dilemmas by instilling positive social norms (Ostrom 1990;Fehr and Gaechter 2000;Chaudhuri 2011 provides a recent survey).,2,ssc
"Without data on both expectations and contributions, it can be difficult to identify the strategies adopted by participants in economic games, a necessary step to test fully theories of cooperation.",2,ssc
"In a highly congested road, for example, at peak hours commuting car drivers are not willing to share the road or let other vehicles use the road space correctly, exacerbating the tragedy associated with the overuse of that road space, even if this is highly inefficient.",1,ssc
"Under naturally occurring circumstances, search costs and switching costs, as well as fluctuations in individual performance, tend to delay regrouping.",1,ssc
"In many social-game protocols, ranging from gift-exchange over ultimatum bargaining to public-good situations, human behaviour differs substantially from the Nash-equilibrium that results if we assume that players care only about their own monetary payoff.",2,ssc
"We find that in the presence of conditional cooperators, common knowledge does enhance efficiency mostly because the advice left in this treatment is more exhortative.",3,ssc
The type of prisoner's dilemma game influenced the strength of the observed correlation between discounting and cooperation.,1,ssc
The difference between the group-representative and group-all condition was interpreted as consistent with a prediction that intergroup contact can reduce competitiveness even when there is conflict and the absence of norms requiring cooperative behavior.,2,ssc
"Secondly, the experience of conflict may create or deepen ingroup identity, strengthening other-regarding preferences toward in-group members and making it more attractive to cooperate within groups.",2,ssc
"(If commitments are more than just con-  .20 tracts with particular people, but are also prebehavior choices to behave in a particular way, such a correlation will occur even after a switch has been made and the contractual relevance of the people to whom the commitments were made has been removed.)",1,ssc
This conditional behaviour may even inhibit the process of discovering the profitable strategy.,2,ssc
"It has been hypothesized that social learning has played a pivotal role in making human societies cooperative, by favouring cooperation even when it is not favoured by genetical selection.",2,ssc
"Thus, if the default effect is partly explained by information conveyance, we expect to find it less pronounced when the default contribution can be a randomly drawn number over the support of choices in the game.",2,ssc
"Consistent with our second hypothesis, which predicts that relationship duration mediates the impact of tie strength on cooperation, we find that both the main effect of tie value and its interaction with the number of tie swaps are diminished, relative to Model 2. The main effect decreases by 64% (from −.069 to −.025), and the interaction with the number of tie swaps decreases by 65% (from .029 to .01).",3,ssc
"We consider nondivisibility to be the more important factor in determining individual members' willingness to contribute to the provision of the public good, because it directly affects the value of the good to the individual.",3,ssc
"If there were no time value, then there would be no advantage to hiring an agent first (since the other party would respond by hiring an agent instantaneously), and therefore a prisoner's dilemma could not exist.",2,ssc
"Intuitively it can be expected that the tendency to defect will increase with group size N and costs K, and will decrease with the incentive U.",2,ssc
"This implies that there are signs that moving beliefs may have been one of the channels through which priming affected contributions, but this channel seems to be surprisingly weak and statistically insignificant.",2,ssc
"In line with these predictions, Pellegrini & Long (2002) have observed an initial increase in aggressive competition as adolescents moved from primary to secondary school, and bullying behavior appeared to mediate dominance status during this transition.",3,ssc
"During donation choices, peer presence resulted in higher donations and enhanced activity in several social brain regions including the muff, TPJ, precuneus and STS.",3,ssc
"Berkowitz (1960) has demonstrated that unexpected frustrations produce more hostility than expected frustrations and, what is more important for the study reported here, that subjects who expect hostility and receive friendliness will reveal a greater trend toward friendliness than those subjects who have a reason to expect friendliness.",3,ssc
"interactions reduce the degree of control in the experiment because it is difficult to assess whether appearances, show banter, and the like influence observed decisions.",3,ssc
"This earlier experience, we find, causes the players to update their expectations, leading more groups to choose the tipping game compared to the treatment in which groups lack this experience.",3,ssc
"A possible explanation is that the cooperation norm is more salient in the former than in the latter, due to the fact that in ""public,"" everyone observes punishments for norm violations.",3,ssc
"Research also shows that when people adopt a more abstract or higher construal level (Trope & Liberman, 2010)-that is, they feel more psychological distance-they show more pro-self-orientation, leading them to engage in behaviors that fit with the social motivation they endorse (Giacomantonio, De Dreu, Shalvi, Sligte, & Leder, 2010).",2,ssc
The first conjecture refers to the potentially positive effect that leadership signaling per se may have in catalyzing cooperation.,2,ssc
"Because the profits of having a large herd accrued exclusively to the individual herdsman, whereas the costs in terms of exceeding the carrying capacity of the common were incurred collectively by all herdsmen, each herdsman could gain wealth by grazing increasingly large herds on the common.",2,ssc
""" 5 contexts lead actors to rely more on contributions to the group than competitive contexts, while competitive contexts lead actors to rely more on punishment of others than cooperative contexts.",2,ssc
"In the case of defaults, an endowment effect may be at work: people may perceive the default option as something they possess and, thus, place more value on it.",2,ssc
"In two behavioral experiments, we offer individuals the latter possibility: Participants can work together to increase the total size of the pie and hence increase the size of their own slice.",3,ssc
"For both these reasons, along with the frequently large size of the effects we observe, dynamic partner updating deserves to be considered among the most promising levers for eliciting cooperation between humans, especially in informal settings.",2,ssc
"As for the issue of sanctions, we noted earlier that due to trust based in the system, sanctions can increase expectations of cooperation.",2,ssc
"The results show that uncertainty per se lowers individual but not group contributions, lagged marginal incentives significantly predict contributions, and individuals significantly react to own-deviations from average group contributions.",3,ssc
"Namely, the sequential ordering of the choices that are available to and exercised by interdependent actors, including who makes the opening move, can markedly influence subsequent social decisions.",2,ssc
" Sullivan & Lyle questioned the effect of player-player anonymity, emphasizing that the imperfectness of the anonymity might have influenced play.",2,ssc
"In conservation psychology, the accumulated evidence indicates that people's conservation performance is strongly determined by normative prosocial influences.",2,ssc
"However, the non-monotonicity between observability and deterrence we observe is troubling, because it suggests that simply increasing the ability to monitor outside threats may not lead to better outcomes, and it leaves us unsure about what level of observability is required to generate better outcomes.",1,ssc
"Certainly, strong social bonds make visualizations of others easier, providing a firmer impetus for volunteering.",3,ssc
"A number of studies have argued that survey-based measures have to be treated with caution in the CDD context and that this may explain the mixed evidence on CDD and social capital in the first place (Avdeenko & Gilligan, 2015;Ban et al., 2015;Mansuri & Rao, 2013;Wong, 2012).",2,ssc
"Relying on the same measure of trust, Knack and Keefer (1997) showed that an increase in the level of trust positively affects the annual growth rate of per capita income.",3,ssc
Our experiments have led us to conclude that cooperation rates can be radically affected by one factor in particular.. . .,2,ssc
"First, the task of learning and familiarization was harder, since the first choice of rules occurred before subjects had any experience interacting in a VCM with or without punishment.",1,ssc
"When such conditions exist, there is an intraclass correlation (ICC), and the assumption of independence of observations for regular regression is violated (Hox, 1998;Kreft & De Leeuw, 1998;Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002).",2,ssc
"Due to random encounters, this initial defection will spread at random throughout the economy.",2,ssc
"Here we present a theory of why (and for whom) intuition favors cooperation: cooperation is typically advantageous in everyday life, leading to the formation of generalized cooperative intuitions.",3,ssc
"An examination of histograms of scores for each condition suggests that people tended to lapse into either full cooperation or full defection in the no communication condition, which greatly increases the variance of the condition.",3,ssc
When the first mover cooperated there is a clear decline in cooperation as scores in perspective taking increase.,3,ssc
Increased average contributions with excludability are caused by significantly fewer free riders and more full contributors; see the last column of Tables B2.1 and B2.2 in the Appendix.,3,ssc
It was concluded that the high degree of competitiveness typically found in PD game studies may be largely a function of the isolation imposed on the subjects by the experimenter.,2,ssc
"However, self-deception could also vary as a function of the situation and may be a facultative mechanism.",2,ssc
"If it is considered 'fair' to contribute to a public good, perhaps because others are also doing so, then many people will be prepared to make voluntary contributions.",3,ssc
"Longer cycles allow a better identification of strategies, so as cycle duration increases a larger strategy set is needed to fit a given number of observations.",3,ssc
"Clearly, the salience of social categories may be important in order to create cooperation within groups (e.g.",2,ssc
Behavior in the experiment will support the hypothesis that moral opinions are conditional on the behavior of others if subjects report personal normative beliefs increasing in the average contribution level of group members.,2,ssc
"Because we conjectured that the opportunity for punishing would have a larger impact if subjects could learn about the behaviour of other group members, we repeated the basic public goods gameÐwith and without punishment opportunity, depending on the treatmentÐfor six periods.",2,ssc
"Thus, much like the real world, if harvesters mismanaged the resource during the early stages of the simulation, there was less available during the later stages.",3,ssc
"Outside the laboratory, partner preferences and time constraints typically inhibit equal rates of interaction between group members, the result being that people (and other social animals) interact with some individuals more than others.",1,ssc
This result is consistent with a previous study which suggests that behaving dishonestly leads to the forgetting of rules [24].,3,ssc
"However, as an adaptation of beliefs to feedback is likely to occur, we may expect in line with the adaptive conditional-cooperation conjecture (Neugebauer et al. 2009) that the contributions positively respond to the past continuation-payoff differential.",2,ssc
"To summarize, discrimination occurs as an outcome of intergroup bias where the discrimination is not a result of hostility toward out-group members, but is rather a result of in-group loving.",3,ssc
"We speculate that when members of successful groups made their investment choices, they conformed to an inferred-but illusory-norm of ""cooperativeness"" within the group.",2,ssc
"As to the control variables, the number of members is significant and negative, indicating that groups with more members are less likely to be in the zero delinquency category.",3,ssc
"These findings, coupled with the fact that there is widespread mis-reporting of token values are suggestive of why groups are unable to use the 'token revelation' stage for much gain in efficiency.",1,ssc
"We found that when people's mortality was not called to their attention, a need-focused appeal had more influence on their donation decisions than a bandwagon appeal.",3,ssc
"Thus, with the reputation mechanism, there is a clear increase in the level of cooperation, which increases with experience.",3,ssc
Participants cooperated more when OP received higher rewards.,3,ssc
"The second insight is that the inefficiency observed in heterogeneous groups is not only due to the inefficiently low levels of contribution, but also due to a relative underuse of rewards.",3,ssc
"We also found that institutions are associated with the marginal effects of diversity: Diversity reduces contributions to public goods as expected, but only when students come from segregated institutions.",1,ssc
"The results of this study suggest that while it is true that people with an altruistic or cooperative orientation will participate more than those with an individualistic or competitive orientation, their participation is likely to be reduced if they observe other membersÕ defection behavior.",2,ssc
"It relies on the idea that people react to unfair intentions by sacrificing a part of their payoffs in order to punish others, even when there are no reputation gains from doing so (Rabin 1993;Falk and Fischbacher 2006).",3,ssc
"This interpretation suggests that if the factors that weaken the case for the dominant or competitive choice were eliminated in the repeated-play PD, the prescriptive behavior would be obtained.",2,ssc
"This implies that conflict increases parochialism both by increasing preferences for in-group cooperation, and by decreasing preferences for out-group cooperation.",3,ssc
Permitting continuous rather than binary ''all-or-nothing'' contributions significantly increases contributions and facilitates provision.,3,ssc
We used this proportional measure of punishment rather than the raw amounts that participants spent for punishing each trader because the total amount that they spent for punishment varied among participants.,3,ssc
We use an experiment with multiple threshold public goods to show how increasing the number of public goods vying for funding can decrease both total contributions across all goods and the probability that any public good receives enough donations to succeed.,3,ssc
"First, models of information signaling have shown that sequential giving can have beneficial effects for voluntary public good provision when the common value of the public good is uncertain.",2,ssc
"In these experiments, which allow subjects to punish non-cooperators at a cost to themselves, the moderate levels of contribution typically observed in early play often rise in subsequent rounds to near the maximal level rather than declining to insubstantial levels, as in the case where no punishment is permitted.",3,ssc
Locus of control fosters cooperation for internals with high levels of cooperative education because those people are able to use their background as a means towards an end in that they believe that they can influence their desired outcomes.,3,ssc
This forwards the interesting and paradoxical hypothesis that inducing the unpleasant feeling of guilt in a fellow group member may in itself be beneficial because it actually allows one to build a reputation of being a cooperator (cf.,2,ssc
An important consequence of this increase in average effort is that the aggregate monetary payoff increases by 40% even if one takes the payoff reductions that result from actual punishments into account.,3,ssc
"Beyond the social dilemma game, it is expected that if happiness is displayed, a cooperative in contrast to a self-interested message will more likely lead to meeting up with the other.",2,ssc
"First, if women were more unconditionally cooperative than men, they should contribute more to the public good than men even when controlling for expectations.",2,ssc
"When people do not know the victims and have little if any positive regard for them, their donation behavior may be influenced primarily by criteria that they apply independently of their feelings of sympathy or empathy.",2,ssc
It was our expectation that news stories reporting events which were caused by human agents would temporarily influence a subject's beliefs about the surrounding social universe and hence affect his behavior toward and expectation of the presumed stranger with whom he was paired in the nonzero sum game.,2,ssc
"II it was predicted that Ss would exploit an egotistical opponent to a greater extent when future interaction was anticipated than when it was not, but that when the opponent was seen to be self-effacing Lhe reverse would be true.",2,ssc
"Furthermore, we believe that participants who punish cheaters are those who espouse the state of mutual cooperation as a goal and thus might feel guilty for not punishing cheaters and thus failing to promote mutual cooperation.",2,ssc
natives and the resulting payoffs may change in time) are interrelated in the sense that the changes in the reward structure and the sequence by which different conflicts are entered depend upon the way previous conflicts were resolved.,2,ssc
Working together on a team-building task enhanced cooperative tendencies even with little or no financial incentive for performing the task.,3,ssc
"First, the higher the payoff foregone by a freerider when not receiving rewards, the more likely he/she is to act (more) cooperatively in the social dilemma game in order to attract rewards.",1,ssc
"It is now well established that imagined contact can facilitate more positive intergroup attitudes and friendship-related emotions (Crisp & Turner, 2009).",2,ssc
"Although a principally exploitative relationship between owners and drivers does not necessarily improve intergroup relations, familiarity with intergroup economic ties may explain the lack of ethnic bias in the laboratory game.",2,ssc
"Second, deviation from the dominant strategy leads to a higher joint payoff for the group, and enough contributions produce an outcome that is Pareto superior to the dominant strategy equilibrium outcome.",3,ssc
"In this line of thought, individual utility arise not only from material outcomes but also from the comparison of own and other people's pay-offs.",3,ssc
The presence of such a leader tends to increase coordination.,1,ssc
"If so, a denomination's position on the church-sect continuum -which may also be represented by its theological position -may help to explain its members' giving patterns.",2,ssc
This result suggests that language activates group norms in a heterogeneous fashion: if different people's latent identities differ they can respond in very different ways to identical linguistic cues.,1,ssc
"First, despite the asymmetric nature of the best-shot provision technology, heterogeneity can help overcome coordination problems by providing focal points as a coordination tool.",2,ssc
"The reasoning is that in high-trust societies, most people already contribute to the public good: The belief that most others can be trusted renders punishment an unnecessary cost to encourage contributions.",3,ssc
"In contrast, if the negativity bias argument applies to the VCM setting, then these two ratings may produce asymmetric levels of cooperation, as predicted by the hypothesis.",2,ssc
"Evidence suggests that friendships are impaired by social anxiety disorder (SAD) (Rodebaugh, 2009).",3,ssc
"The persistence of identity activation may depend on many things, including the strength and complexity of the initial activating cue and the presence of other identity-congruent cues in the environment.",2,ssc
The results suggest that remembering an experience of rejection can trigger anger and ruminating on being rejected can trigger indirect aggression.,1,ssc
We propose that it is because task-related and task-unrelated communications activate different norms.,3,ssc
Our findings also showed that participants' scores on a Prosocial value domain derived from Rokeach's terminal values were indicative of their cooperation preferences in the PGGs.,1,ssc
"We find that third parties punished more frequently, severely and less antisocially, resulting in a higher contribution level than that driven by second-party punishment.",3,ssc
"Specifically, highly extrinsic primary participants tended to select other materialists as peers to participate in the study.",1,ssc
"In particular, participating in a low-payment choice before making a high-payment choice magnifies the scale of the utility received/payoff from the subsequent task.",3,ssc
"However, when access is equally distributed, group members will be more willing to act in a way that advances the interests of the group rather than just their own (i.e., they will be more cooperative).",3,ssc
The fact that the cooperative robot always followed through with the stated intent should have enhanced the perception of it as trustworthy.,2,ssc
Sequential contributions decrease to the predicted equilibrium level and fall below the greater-than-expected contributions in the simultaneous game.,3,ssc
"Lastly, because greedy people are never satisfied with their current state of affairs, it is likely that this affects their wellbeing in a negative way.",1,ssc
When communication within teams is possible communication is an efficient means to coordinate team members' efforts at higher levels and to reduce the free-rider problem within teams.,3,ssc
"Yet, when group identification was high, both leader types appeared to be equally efficient.",2,ssc
"If a game is to be played many times, consideration of the cooperative choice may increase, since players can attempt to influence their opponent's future behavior.",2,ssc
Isaac and Walker (1988b) present experimental evidence that the ability to talk among group members participating in a public goods game leads to increased cooperation in the form of higher contributions and lower free-riding.,3,ssc
"Importantly, we found that the results of the two studies depart primarily because of differences in cooperation rates in settings with a known end round.",3,ssc
"In models based on income differences, if responders care for the utility of the other responder, then in addition to receiving disutility because the take authority has a higher income than they do, they will also receive disutility because the take authority has higher income than their friend does.",3,ssc
"The public-goods literature finds that as groups increase in size individuals become more hesitant to cooperate and less able to coordinate actions (Franzen, 1995;Knez & Camerer, 1994).",3,ssc
"Moreover, excluding incentives related to time preferences could result in an overestimation of investment levels in public goods with long-term benefits.",2,ssc
People who sacrifice on behalf of others like themselves are more prone to the self-interest illusion because they see the benefits as going to people who are like themselves in some salient way.,3,ssc
When numerical cheap talk was combined with a punishment option there were many cheap talk threats of punishment and cheap talk responses with higher cheap talk contributions.,3,ssc
