Result 3. The choice of receiving feedback about individual earnings rather than about individual contributions is associated with a decrease in one's contribution in the next period.,1,ssc
"When groups contributed more than 125 total tokens, efficiency was reduced because contributions over the minimum were not returned to individuals and were thus wasted.",3,ssc
This equilibrium arises because with more than one person contributing at least one contribution is wasted because that second person would be better off by not contributing.,2,ssc
"In contrast, if the negativity bias argument applies to the VCM setting, then these two ratings may produce asymmetric levels of cooperation, as predicted by the hypothesis.",2,ssc
When numerical cheap talk was combined with a punishment option there were many cheap talk threats of punishment and cheap talk responses with higher cheap talk contributions.,3,ssc
"(If commitments are more than just con-  .20 tracts with particular people, but are also prebehavior choices to behave in a particular way, such a correlation will occur even after a switch has been made and the contractual relevance of the people to whom the commitments were made has been removed.)",1,ssc
"Furthermore, we believe that participants who punish cheaters are those who espouse the state of mutual cooperation as a goal and thus might feel guilty for not punishing cheaters and thus failing to promote mutual cooperation.",2,ssc
"It is the combination of chronic, self-protective mistrust with hyperactivated affiliation that leads to inconsistency and increased decisional effort.",3,ssc
"Certainly, strong social bonds make visualizations of others easier, providing a firmer impetus for volunteering.",3,ssc
"Because the approach of pausing first-order collective action for multiple punishment stages has been explored extensively by others and because situations that it may fail to mirror well strike us as common and important, we study higher-order punishment in a repeated play dilemma game with the constraint that the number of punishment stages not exceed the number of contribution stages by more than a factor of two.",2,ssc
"If both firms opt for the low Nash equilibrium price, though, market-level profits and wages will be minimized.",3,ssc
It is therefore possible that the higher rates of cooperation in PD are (partly) due to the smaller size of the action set.,1,ssc
"In this paper, we neither attribute behavioral differences between the 'elite' and the rest of society to endowment differences nor to self selection (a positive correlation between selfishness and endowment); rather we hypothesize in line with Cote et al. (2015) and Heap et al. (2016) that the inequality in the society itself makes elite members more selfish and less generous.",2,ssc
They produce evidence to support the notion that a greater MPCR distance increases contribution by making the gains from cooperation in the social dilemma more salient for all group members. 18,3,ssc
Our study tests why discounting a belief in free will increases the likelihood of uncooperative behavior.,3,ssc
"A second experiment demonstrates that when electoral delegation must be endogenously implemented, individuals voluntarily cede authority to an elected agent only when preplay communication is permitted.",2,ssc
"Windfall gains (e.g., winning the lottery) may lead to greater altruism, but wealth attained through participation in a market economy may not, since as Melvin Lerner and James Meindl (1981:219) note, ""coming to the aid of a person in need and sensitivity to their deservingness will occur if such responsiveness does not pose a threat to the actor's own deservingness.""",2,ssc
"However, people seem unwilling to use a commitment mechanism if doing so exposes them to being free ridden.",2,ssc
"In contrast, increasing individuals' awareness of their mortality apparently leads them to base their donation decisions on the social desirability of providing help, as reflected in the amount of help provided in the past (Experiments 1-3) and others' preferences (Experiment 4).",3,ssc
"We find that in the presence of conditional cooperators, common knowledge does enhance efficiency mostly because the advice left in this treatment is more exhortative.",3,ssc
"Based on the above reasoning, we predicted that individuals who anticipate pride about acting fairly would be more likely to divide resources between themselves and another in a fair way, whereas those who anticipate regret about acting fairly would be less likely to do so.",1,ssc
"Previous research indicates that people who strongly identified with the in-group are more competitive toward the out-group (e.g., Chase, 1992).",2,ssc
"II it was predicted that Ss would exploit an egotistical opponent to a greater extent when future interaction was anticipated than when it was not, but that when the opponent was seen to be self-effacing Lhe reverse would be true.",2,ssc
"On a more general level, the present study generates new insights into the relation between social uncertainty and environmental uncertainty by showing that the way in which people deal with social uncertainty is affected by the uncertainty people may experience regarding environmental information (cf.",1,ssc
Bargainers with a significant threat tend to threaten and fine more often.,2,ssc
"As a consequence, confounding effects such as reputation building through punishment or strategic reasons for punishing to increase cooperation in repeated interactions, as shown by Gächter et al. (2004) and Gächter and Herrmann (2009), can be excluded and a clear theoretical benchmark for standard preferences can be derived.",1,ssc
We used this proportional measure of punishment rather than the raw amounts that participants spent for punishing each trader because the total amount that they spent for punishment varied among participants.,3,ssc
"As for the issue of sanctions, we noted earlier that due to trust based in the system, sanctions can increase expectations of cooperation.",2,ssc
"If participants in the Public Goods Game exhibit loss aversion, they will react more strongly to the prospect of being punished than to potential rewards; thus making punishment the more effective enforcement mechanism.",3,ssc
"When such conditions exist, there is an intraclass correlation (ICC), and the assumption of independence of observations for regular regression is violated (Hox, 1998;Kreft & De Leeuw, 1998;Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002).",2,ssc
"If there were no time value, then there would be no advantage to hiring an agent first (since the other party would respond by hiring an agent instantaneously), and therefore a prisoner's dilemma could not exist.",2,ssc
"An examination of histograms of scores for each condition suggests that people tended to lapse into either full cooperation or full defection in the no communication condition, which greatly increases the variance of the condition.",3,ssc
These simulation results thus lend support to our claim that the strength of ties between actors can contribute to the evolution of cooperation in dynamic networks.,2,ssc
"Thus, much like the real world, if harvesters mismanaged the resource during the early stages of the simulation, there was less available during the later stages.",3,ssc
"Cooperative corporate culture can be nurtured by starting small, as Weber (2006)  shows experimentally with a coordination game.",2,ssc
"Because there is attention to the content of the choices, WCLD becomes an affective version of TFT rather than a mere mimic.",3,ssc
"But with simultaneous decisions, the risk that others might not cooperate can lead players to defect (the risk-dominant equilibrium).",2,ssc
I do not conserve energy because it benefits others at a cost to myself.,3,ssc
"Thus, a leader who dislikes disadvantageous inequality would tend to opt for NEG as an incentive scheme.",1,ssc
If all participants adopt the strategy of never using the bus then they will each receive an earning of £25.,2,ssc
"The public-goods literature finds that as groups increase in size individuals become more hesitant to cooperate and less able to coordinate actions (Franzen, 1995;Knez & Camerer, 1994).",3,ssc
Our experiments have led us to conclude that cooperation rates can be radically affected by one factor in particular.. . .,2,ssc
"As such, people from different societies will tend to express different preferences and beliefs: one should be able to measure between-group variation.",2,ssc
"If it is true that antisocial punishment is based on the intuitive system and especially likely executed by individuals with a proneness to sadistic tendencies, then the inhibition of the intuitive system should reduce antisocial punishment in individuals with a proneness to sadistic tendencies.",2,ssc
"This is evidence that is consistent with the hypothesis that the Perfect Strangers treatment affects qualitative behavior, in the sense that it elicits more subjects to focus on the zero contribution response.",3,ssc
The fact that the cooperative robot always followed through with the stated intent should have enhanced the perception of it as trustworthy.,2,ssc
We present a novel laboratory reciprocity experiment (the double-dictator game with sorting) and show that failure to account for external motives leads to a significant overestimation of internal motives such as fairness and altruism.,3,ssc
"If it is considered 'fair' to contribute to a public good, perhaps because others are also doing so, then many people will be prepared to make voluntary contributions.",3,ssc
The groups convened in separate adjacent classrooms to prevent communication between groups.,3,ssc
"Here we show that, unlike material sanctions, moral judgments do not result in cycles of recrimination and tend to ""crowd in"" interpersonal trust, trustworthiness, and generosity.",3,ssc
"Consequently, emotional responses from past exchanges influences the behavior of actors in the future.",3,ssc
""" 5 contexts lead actors to rely more on contributions to the group than competitive contexts, while competitive contexts lead actors to rely more on punishment of others than cooperative contexts.",2,ssc
"Selfish players may choose to reveal private information through costless and non-binding communication or cheap talk; such revelation can lead to efficiency gains, as shown by Crawford and Sobel (1982).",2,ssc
"Both the Outcome for Others and the Equality of Outcomes depend on others, meaning when the total group is greater than two people, these others' properties are combinations of multiple people's behaviors, not just a single individual's behavior.",2,ssc
"On one hand, these findings partially confirm our speculation vis-à-vis the role of risk taking: reciprocators were not necessarily cooperators under conditions of uncertainty, as some of them chose to cooperate because they could bear a high risk in anticipating the counterpart's goodwill.",3,ssc
"The maintenance of social norms often depends on external enforcement, as in the absence of credible sanctioning mechanisms prosocial behaviour deteriorates quickly.",3,ssc
"That is, when there is no noise, there is an increase in cooperation over successive interactions (at least in the context of TFT and TFT ϩ 1 strategies).",3,ssc
The point we try to make is that trust is relatively less important in the AG compared to the PG because the removal of the temptation to free ride in the former strengthens incentives to cooperate.,3,ssc
"If the goal-transformation hypothesis is correct, then the behavior of proselfs should be affected more strongly by the type of identity that is salient (personal vs. group).",3,ssc
"Gaining from the public good provided by their group, subjects increased their initial budget of 200 Rs by 59%.",3,ssc
"In two behavioral experiments, we offer individuals the latter possibility: Participants can work together to increase the total size of the pie and hence increase the size of their own slice.",3,ssc
"For example, one study showed that when perceived moral levels were lower than participants' actual moral levels, the moral licensing effect resulted in reduction of the frequency of ethical behaviors, and when participants perceived higher moral levels, they showed an increase in ethical behavior [47].",3,ssc
"The intuition is that in that case there always exist strategy combinations in which a single (pivotal) player's investment in monitoring causes an increase of the MPCR above 1, transferring the public into a private good and making the investment profitable and, as a consequence, making positive investments in monitoring individually rational.",3,ssc
"Second, deviation from the dominant strategy leads to a higher joint payoff for the group, and enough contributions produce an outcome that is Pareto superior to the dominant strategy equilibrium outcome.",3,ssc
"Generational differences, maturation, and cultural shift imply that stereotype activation should not affect Millennial entitlement because the change in entitlement occurred in the past and is observed retrospectively.",2,ssc
"Because we conjectured that the opportunity for punishing would have a larger impact if subjects could learn about the behaviour of other group members, we repeated the basic public goods gameÐwith and without punishment opportunity, depending on the treatmentÐfor six periods.",2,ssc
"Further, because direct reciprocity was not possible in our experiments, sharing arrangements were not self-enforcing.",3,ssc
"Yet, when group identification was high, both leader types appeared to be equally efficient.",2,ssc
"Second, it was concluded that highly threatening situations minimize the effects of idiosyncratic motives, perhaps arousing a common defensive motive.",3,ssc
My understanding of people's ideas about cooperation in Kamchatka was significantly enhanced by the opportunity to refer back to the game when explaining my thoughts and posing my questions.,1,ssc
"Thus, representatives successfully advanced the interests of their constituencies when bargaining with persons who did not have constituencies of their own.",3,ssc
"Thus, if the default effect is partly explained by information conveyance, we expect to find it less pronounced when the default contribution can be a randomly drawn number over the support of choices in the game.",2,ssc
"The individual -group discontinuity effect entails that in mixed-motive situations, such as the Prisoner's Dilemma game (PDG), intergroup interactions are more competitive than inter-individual interactions.",2,ssc
"n their interpretation of the way affect functions to alter behavior, Rosenhan et al. comment: Negative affect by definition increases the psychological distance between self and other.",3,ssc
"For cooperators, focused contrasts indicated that negative moods produced more cooperation (less competition) than either positive or control moods, ts( 77 In short, Study 2 provides further support for our ideas by assessing goals as they ""naturally"" occur, overcoming any potential limitations on varying goals via instructions.",3,ssc
"In other words, acceptance would be more common if the subjects' expectations were met because, although a shared concept of fairness exists, fairness is sensitive to different factors (personal, situational, and social) that influence expectations and fairness perception.",1,ssc
"However, there are also reasons to think that the treatment will lead to low contributions, since the reaction to the comprehension/advice combination may be defensive.",2,ssc
"If industries can relocate easily, then the level of pollution would depend on the country with the weakest environmental regulation.",3,ssc
This forwards the interesting and paradoxical hypothesis that inducing the unpleasant feeling of guilt in a fellow group member may in itself be beneficial because it actually allows one to build a reputation of being a cooperator (cf.,2,ssc
"However, we have to recognize that as the subjective probabilities go to zero, the economic impact of choices becomes weak.",3,ssc
Both effects should cause increase in public-good provision at least at level 1.,2,ssc
"The def change having occurred prior to the verbal response trial (B 2 ) suggests that negative attitude change, after harm, may inhibit retaliatory behavior  for Group DL and, to some extent, for Group N.",2,ssc
"Our result suggests that the selfish prediction is prone to deviations when the equilibrium results in unequal distributions of payoffs, and there are alternative outcomes that increase both equality and the payoff of the disadvantaged party.",2,ssc
"As Axelrod (1984) has noted, when discount rates increase the probability that a defecting strategy is optimal also increases.",3,ssc
"More interesting, however, is that the Sanction × Options interaction effect showed that the sanction increased the collective outcomes only in the two options condition.",3,ssc

"When early humans used dogs as hunting partners, they most likely increased their intake of protein (Koster & Tankersley, 2012;Ruusila & Pesonen, 2004).",2,ssc
"In sum, the content analysis of communication provides further evidence that conflict expenditures in OPEN are lower than in the other treatments because subjects discuss and successfully implement turn taking behavior between groups.",3,ssc
"Depending on the parametrization, this new game can have egalitarian equilibria as well as asymmetric solutions, leaving one player worse off.",2,ssc
"Because of the partner design, this yields 18 independent observations for each treatment.",3,ssc
"Because contributions exert a positive externality that is non-rival and non-excludable on anyone who cares about the provision of education material in the local school, we consider them a pure public good from the donor's perspective.",3,ssc
"In both the minimum-effort game and the public goods game, social interaction implies that subjects' choices of numbers or contributions, respectively, are affected by the choices of their neighbors.",1,ssc
"In a simultaneous PGD, risk-averse prosocials defect more than risk-seeking prosocials do because risk-averse prosocials are more worried about losing their endowments than their risk-seeking counterparts.",3,ssc
The fothfun mechanism thus leads to less cooperation than in the baseline case with no punishment if the detrimental effect of retaliatory punishment is greater than the positive norm-enforcing effect of punishment.,2,ssc
Through some mechanismperhaps biological (Trivers 1971) -cooperation on the part of one individual in a dilemma situation enhances the probability that others will cooperate later in that same situation or a similar one.,3,ssc
"Nonetheless, we feel that it is worthwhile showing that the extra step of instrumenting for received messages does not affect our main conclusion: there is a causal relationship between receiving an explicit threat and cheating on collusive agreements.",3,ssc
"Intuitively it can be expected that the tendency to defect will increase with group size N and costs K, and will decrease with the incentive U.",2,ssc
"Due to the missing information on individual evasion of other group members, there is no potential for a contagion effect in the baseline treatment.",3,ssc
"As is argued in the literature, the effects of these punishments are clear: cooperation is established and maintained Sefton, Shupp & Walker (2002).",3,ssc
"The contextual effects caused by the mean, range, and rank of the distribution confirmed our expectations that these relativity effects are due to some general underlying cognitive mechanisms.",3,ssc
"If one (or more) of the players is ""competitively oriented,"" he continues to exploit the other player or players until they must respond with self-protective noncooperation as well.",2,ssc
"Taken together, our results illustrate the importance of equality as a normative criterion and how the efficacy of communication is reduced in the presence of normative conflict.",3,ssc
"For both these reasons, along with the frequently large size of the effects we observe, dynamic partner updating deserves to be considered among the most promising levers for eliciting cooperation between humans, especially in informal settings.",2,ssc
"This is because probability theory will predict that individuals will not allocate higher weight to any particular numbers, because the probability of winning should be the same for all numbers.",3,ssc
"We speculate that when members of successful groups made their investment choices, they conformed to an inferred-but illusory-norm of ""cooperativeness"" within the group.",2,ssc
"Then, the higher is the contribution of the human player required to achieve the non-cooperative optimum, the lower is the expected proportion of ambiguity averse choices.",3,ssc
"However, because condition SQ6 is played after the subject gains much experience with the task, and in particular after experiencing the fifth position in condition SQ5, we anticipate fewer violations of the model in condition SQ6 than in condition SQ in experiment 1. METHOD Subjects.",2,ssc
"It serves people's short-term self interest not to contribute to the establishment of an authority, but if none or only few group members cooperate there will be no authority in place to monitor the good, and therefore the good may fail to be provided.",2,ssc
"The institutional mechanism implemented in Study 1 is richer than an ultimatum game and simultaneously changes the incentive structure depending on the priors of the participants: if players believe that others will contribute at levels just above the lowest current contributor, and believe that others believe this, pure self-interest will generate the observed ratchet pattern.",3,ssc
natives and the resulting payoffs may change in time) are interrelated in the sense that the changes in the reward structure and the sequence by which different conflicts are entered depend upon the way previous conflicts were resolved.,2,ssc
"In a highly congested road, for example, at peak hours commuting car drivers are not willing to share the road or let other vehicles use the road space correctly, exacerbating the tragedy associated with the overuse of that road space, even if this is highly inefficient.",1,ssc
"Research on legitimacy of authorities has shown that perceived legitimacy, in particular a shared sense of legitimacy, creates voluntary compliance with norms (ZELDITCH and WALKER 1984;TYLER 1997).",3,ssc
"Interacting with others in large populations without structure greatly reduces the likelihood of cooperation (11), but in a fixed social network cooperation can evolve as a consequence of repeated interactions because of ""social viscosity,"" even in the absence of reputation effects or strategic complexity (1,2).",3,ssc
"This implies that there are signs that moving beliefs may have been one of the channels through which priming affected contributions, but this channel seems to be surprisingly weak and statistically insignificant.",2,ssc
"We find that third parties punished more frequently, severely and less antisocially, resulting in a higher contribution level than that driven by second-party punishment.",3,ssc
"This suggests that learning interdependence only as outcomes are experienced over time, as is typical in the real world, may hinder realizations that cooperation will build the trust of others and even increase one's own well-being in the long run.",2,ssc
"Individual-scale variables like wealth and education may affect the costs of public goods provisioning or the benefits of short-term defection, and so wealthier and more educated individuals who can obtain resources more readily can expect to be more generous.",2,ssc
"Information enables players to decide whether to trust the others in the group and cooperate, once they are aware that cooperation can achieve a superior outcome.",2,ssc
The presence of such a leader tends to increase coordination.,1,ssc
"Otherwise, if the accumulated gain explains the behaviour of the birds but the one trial gain does not, then the birds are making decisions based on the four trial reward and are playing a mutualism game.",2,ssc
The difference between the group-representative and group-all condition was interpreted as consistent with a prediction that intergroup contact can reduce competitiveness even when there is conflict and the absence of norms requiring cooperative behavior.,2,ssc
"Outside the laboratory, partner preferences and time constraints typically inhibit equal rates of interaction between group members, the result being that people (and other social animals) interact with some individuals more than others.",1,ssc
"When the subject is faced with positive contribution to the public good by the computer, cooperative behavior can also be driven by inequality aversion and conditional cooperation.",2,ssc
Previous research has shown that behavior aligns with self-interest only when self-interest is salient.,2,ssc
The results show that cooperation was higher when people could leave bad partners versus when they could not.,2,ssc
"In many social-game protocols, ranging from gift-exchange over ultimatum bargaining to public-good situations, human behaviour differs substantially from the Nash-equilibrium that results if we assume that players care only about their own monetary payoff.",3,ssc
"Moreover, excluding incentives related to time preferences could result in an overestimation of investment levels in public goods with long-term benefits.",2,ssc
"Because participants generally cooperate withand rarely defect againstcooperators in the iterated PDG, the resulting distribution of the number of rounds participants cooperate tends to be severely non-normal.",2,ssc

"Threat of revenge induce more deliberation on punishment and reduces other perverse punishment, which will have a positive impact on cooperation.",3,ssc
Results show that tax publicity reduces both the number of evaders and the amount of tax evaded.,3,ssc
"As one individual increases his or her effort, the personal payoff increases regardless of other individuals' actions (the left panel); however, as the aggregate effort of the other individuals increases, the payoff for that particular individual decreases (the right panel), more clearly demonstrating the negative externality.",3,ssc
"Conversely, when switching from short games to long games, participants immediately begin to cooperate at a high level.",3,ssc

When the first mover cooperated there is a clear decline in cooperation as scores in perspective taking increase.,3,ssc
"Inversely, (2) when students have academic curricula with high levels of background knowledge related to the root causes of environmental problems and the related possible strategic options, the cooperative-competitive context does not matter.",3,ssc
"First, if women were more unconditionally cooperative than men, they should contribute more to the public good than men even when controlling for expectations.",2,ssc

This finding is consistent with publicly-traded firms making relatively larger investments in environmental performance to assuage the concerns of investors.,3,ssc
Violent media may cause viewers to perceive greater anger and less gratitude during a cooperative task and as such be less inclined to cooperate.,2,ssc
"This is to be expected given the plausible assumption that the moralistic punishment by the partners had served to increase participants' willingness to cooperate in Experiments 1 and 2 (consistent with Fehr & Gächter, 2002).",2,ssc
"In two behavioral experiments, we offer individuals the latter possibility: Participants can work together to increase the total size of the pie and hence increase the size of their own slice.",2,ssc
"A decrease over time is consistent with game-theoretical predictions about conditional cooperation, since individuals are expected to eventually modify their behavior over time to maximize their earnings.",3,ssc
"Beyond the social dilemma game, it is expected that if happiness is displayed, a cooperative in contrast to a self-interested message will more likely lead to meeting up with the other.",2,ssc

"It has been hypothesized that social learning has played a pivotal role in making human societies cooperative, by favouring cooperation even when it is not favoured by genetical selection.",2,ssc
Bargainers with a significant threat tend to threaten and fine more often.,1,ssc
"Research also shows that when people adopt a more abstract or higher construal level (Trope & Liberman, 2010)-that is, they feel more psychological distance-they show more pro-self-orientation, leading them to engage in behaviors that fit with the social motivation they endorse (Giacomantonio, De Dreu, Shalvi, Sligte, & Leder, 2010).",2,ssc
"Namely, the sequential ordering of the choices that are available to and exercised by interdependent actors, including who makes the opening move, can markedly influence subsequent social decisions.",2,ssc
"The results show that uncertainty per se lowers individual but not group contributions, lagged marginal incentives significantly predict contributions, and individuals significantly react to own-deviations from average group contributions.",3,ssc
These results suggest that the shared outcomes involved in cooperation did increase cohesiveness.,3,ssc
"The similarity between single-player and multi-player versions of the IPD can provide a powerful research model as the reduction from two to one players reduces the number of uncontrolled and interacting variables involved in the prisoner's dilemma (Fantino, 2004).",2,ssc
"For if such a 'high-trust' society were characterized by the existence of many separate groups producing public goods with negative externalities for each other, the overall result would likely be worse than would have been the case had trust been low.",2,ssc
"Importantly, we found that the results of the two studies depart primarily because of differences in cooperation rates in settings with a known end round.",3,ssc
"We find that contributions are 56.6% higher when group composition is different across both public goods dilemmas as compared to when composition is the same across the two public goods dilemmas (M 1 = 17.7,",3,ssc
"Social marginalization or even exclusion is that cost, and unless the personal payoffs for defection are extremely large, few group members are willing to pay that cost.",3,ssc
"The extent of individual cooperation tends to be higher among high-identifying individuals, either because they place greater value in the good itself (De Cremer & Van Vugt, in press;Kerr, 1996), because they have greater trust in the cooperative intentions of fellow group members (Brann & Foddy, 1987;Brewer & Kramer, 1986;Kramer & Brewer, 1984), or both.",1,ssc
Result 3. The threat of inter-period feuds in LF reduces the frequency of altruistic punishment relative to the Baseline treatment.,3,ssc
Studies using the PDG have shown that emotional states and individual differences related to emotional traits influence cooperation.,1,ssc
The discrepant levels of attention paid to music in relation to consumer behavior and employee or organizational behavior are most clear when considering retail workspaces because (i) customers and employees cohabit the locations and (ii) it is reasonable to expect that music that is selected to influence the behaviors of customers would have similar influences on employees.,1,ssc
"The institutional mechanism implemented in Study 1 is richer than an ultimatum game and simultaneously changes the incentive structure depending on the priors of the participants: if players believe that others will contribute at levels just above the lowest current contributor, and believe that others believe this, pure self-interest will generate the observed ratchet pattern.",2,ssc
"But you should also be careful not to ask for too much, because if at the end of the study everyone's requests add up to more than the $1,000 that is in the pool, then nobody, including yourself, will receive anything.",2,ssc
"Second, the absence of an effect of Openness might also be driven by statistical reasons, due to the structure of the MPT model: Parameter e is defined conditional on non-selfish behavior, which leads to fewer trials per person (and hence a lower statistical efficiency) for the estimation of parameter e than for parameter s.",3,ssc
"Thus, with the reputation mechanism, there is a clear increase in the level of cooperation, which increases with experience.",3,ssc
Ambiguity arises when a decision-maker finds it difficult or impossible to assign a subjective probability to an event.,1,ssc
"Although a principally exploitative relationship between owners and drivers does not necessarily improve intergroup relations, familiarity with intergroup economic ties may explain the lack of ethnic bias in the laboratory game.",2,ssc
"These findings, coupled with the fact that there is widespread mis-reporting of token values are suggestive of why groups are unable to use the 'token revelation' stage for much gain in efficiency.",1,ssc
There are indications that the unequal range of pay-off accelerated the observed trends rather than reversing them.,1,ssc
Liebrand et al. (1986) concluded that cooperators may place a higher value than individualists on how well an interaction satisfies personal or social behavioral standards.,2,ssc
"The results also reveal that the average harvest behavior in the baseline game positively and significantly affects the harvest behavior in the second game, suggesting some persistence of behavior over the two games.",3,ssc
The type of prisoner's dilemma game influenced the strength of the observed correlation between discounting and cooperation.,1,ssc
"Similarly, providing feedback on how one's energy use compares with one's neighbors had reduced consumption among American liberals but may have had the opposite effect among conservatives (80).",2,ssc
"Consistent with our second hypothesis, which predicts that relationship duration mediates the impact of tie strength on cooperation, we find that both the main effect of tie value and its interaction with the number of tie swaps are diminished, relative to Model 2. The main effect decreases by 64% (from −.069 to −.025), and the interaction with the number of tie swaps decreases by 65% (from .029 to .01).",3,ssc
"In fact, a recent agent-based simulation also suggests that gossip-based partner selection increases cooperation, whereas the strategy to defect after knowing about free riders' reputation decreases cooperation 18 .",1,ssc
"A number of studies have argued that survey-based measures have to be treated with caution in the CDD context and that this may explain the mixed evidence on CDD and social capital in the first place (Avdeenko & Gilligan, 2015;Ban et al., 2015;Mansuri & Rao, 2013;Wong, 2012).",2,ssc
"These 2 features make Jan and Marcia socially interdependent, and the rank order of outcomes available to each of them will constitute a Prisoner's Dilemma.",3,ssc
Hypothesis 2: The presence of a threshold constraining participants' activities will lead participants to be less holistic in their cognitive orientations than when a threshold is not present.,3,ssc
"The significant positive coefficient of Negative deviation of j in the first two regressions reveals that the greater the extent of free riding is, the greater is the likelihood and severity of altruistic punishment in the Baseline treatment.",3,ssc
"However, as an adaptation of beliefs to feedback is likely to occur, we may expect in line with the adaptive conditional-cooperation conjecture (Neugebauer et al. 2009) that the contributions positively respond to the past continuation-payoff differential.",2,ssc
"When the objective incentives remain identical, these studies showed that framing the dilemma in terms of ""taking from"" instead of ""contributing to"" increases cooperation (Brewer and Kramer, 1986).",3,ssc
"Thus, because an elected leader refl ects the choice of the group and its members, an elected leader will feel strong support from the followers who will bestow on the leader a high sense of social responsibility ( Julian, Hollander, & Regula, 1969;Kenney et al., 1996).",3,ssc
"Contributions clearly increase in the leverage level of both institutions, irrespective of the treatment.",3,ssc
"Therefore, these results suggest that as people interact during repeated social dilemmas, over time men become increasingly more cooperative than women.",2,ssc
This conditional behaviour may even inhibit the process of discovering the profitable strategy.,2,ssc
One possible reason for the difference between these two studies is that learning effects are more likely to overwhelm the effects of pair IQ in longer games; this may be related to the finding that worker IQ is a stronger predictor of performance in the early months on a new job while IQ's predictive power for worker performance weakens after years spent in the same job (Hunt 1995).,1,ssc
"In this line of thought, individual utility arise not only from material outcomes but also from the comparison of own and other people's pay-offs.",3,ssc
"Collectively, these informal sanctions provide a powerful mechanism for guiding social behavior.",3,ssc
"While less information leads to more equal contributions, subjects focus on group efficiency in case of full information.",3,ssc
"The members of such societies have strong incentives to innovate and to make physical and human capital investments, thereby contributing to socio-economic prosperity and overall welfare.",3,ssc
We also find that the level of contribution under different default options is sensitive to the type of the public goods game employed.,2,ssc
"Policies like the Pigouvian subsidy ignore these non-Nash behaviors, and the result is that inefficient under-extraction is exacerbated in our context.",3,ssc
"Instead, Andreoni (1995), among others, has suggested that this decrease might be due to ""frustrated attempts at kindness.""",2,ssc
"First, models of information signaling have shown that sequential giving can have beneficial effects for voluntary public good provision when the common value of the public good is uncertain.",2,ssc
5. Stability: Groups may be more stable when entry is restricted compared to the other two conditions if subjects are able to generate cooperation.,2,ssc
"Our results show that emotion-regulation knowledge is itself neither positive nor negative, but can facilitate the objectives of individuals whose interests are in doing harm as well as those interested in benefiting the greater good.",2,ssc
"Of course, second graders also shift to A2 or B2 choices, and as soon as one player does so, the chances are high for retaliation on the part of the other.",2,ssc
"Since the same presentation of information was used in her experiment, significant positive effects of trust on group size was observed even in the experimental situation where only this minimal information about others' behavior was presented.",3,ssc
"More specifically, participants influenced by a charismatic leader (i.e., high in self-sacrifice) were found to contribute more money to a charity fund, and this pattern was mediated by perceptions of charisma.",3,ssc
"These were participants with little or no experience from economic games, because, according to the SHH, there will be a negative deliberation effect on cooperation only for subjects with limited experience from economic games and other ""artificial lab environments"" (Rand et al., 2014).",2,ssc
"We also found that institutions are associated with the marginal effects of diversity: Diversity reduces contributions to public goods as expected, but only when students come from segregated institutions.",1,ssc
"It might be the case that the resources contributed by the group members be as costly as resources arriving from outside of the community, but when states have limited funds and personnel, and when communities can derive other kind of gains from, say, participation in self-governing systems, such as increase in trust, social networks and ties, the comparison of externally imposed regulation systems to self-governance deserves also a policy level inquiry.",2,ssc
"Furthermore, the highest contributor in the group earned more prestige when the good was unattainable, suggesting an association between status and conspicuous cooperation (Hypothesis 3).",1,ssc
"Replications with people from other age groups or nations would help to establish the generalizability of these findings, which is important to do because researchers have suggested that apologies and offers of compensation are species-typical ways of promoting forgiveness (e.g., fcfullough, 2008;fcfullough, Kurzban, et al., 2010).",1,ssc
Despite the interesting balance of incentives provided by introducing competition in the workplace -on one hand individual workers may exert more effort to win promotion or make more money while on the other overall production might suffer because of the lack of cooperation among workers -there has been remarkably little empirical work estimating the effect of competition on workplace cooperation.,2,ssc
"However, the non-monotonicity between observability and deterrence we observe is troubling, because it suggests that simply increasing the ability to monitor outside threats may not lead to better outcomes, and it leaves us unsure about what level of observability is required to generate better outcomes.",1,ssc
"The alternative model predicts the following predictions: P 1 : When there is no tax imposed, individual contributions will exceed 5. P 2 : When a tax of 3 is imposed, total individual contributions will exceed the individual contributions made when there is no tax imposed.",2,ssc
When designing emotional agents we have shown how the addition of mood can be used to enhance the decision-making aspect of that agent.,3,ssc
"However, on ratings of group performance, status and attitudinal similarity combined did lead to increased intergroup differentiation, again unaffected by goal relations.",3,ssc
"Thus, they understand that they need to cooperate among themselves if they want to earn money.",1,ssc
"Fear is associated with the goal to avoid risk, which in a social dilemma induces a tendency to avoid exploitation or loss.",1,ssc
The upshot of these comments is that large churches as well as small churches must create a sense of belonging if they are to mitigate members' free riding tendencies and survive.,3,ssc
Our results show that social ties between group members influence both cooperation and norm enforcement -creating substantial differences between M G and SG.,1,ssc
"However, if each individual attempts to maximize his or her self-interest, the collective outcome will be less desirable than if each individual attempts to maximize the collective interest (Dawes, 1980).",3,ssc
"Consider Pruitt and Kimmel's (1977) goal/expectation theory, which states that cooperation is more likely when trust is enhanced, but only if people also have a prosocial orientation (the goal to achieve mutual cooperation), if the trust explanation is true, then people with a prosocial orientation should contribute more when group identity is salient.",2,ssc
Tokens kept have a private value while tokens invested in the public fund generate a 'public good' return by transferring income to the contributor and the rest of the players.,3,ssc
"The larger this bias, the stronger the effect of ignorance on norm compliance.",3,ssc
"Because you contributed ten (10) points, your kept income is zero (0) points and your total income = 0+7.2=7.2 points.",3,ssc
"Longer cycles allow a better identification of strategies, so as cycle duration increases a larger strategy set is needed to fit a given number of observations.",3,ssc
My understanding of people's ideas about cooperation in Kamchatka was significantly enhanced by the opportunity to refer back to the game when explaining my thoughts and posing my questions.,2,ssc
"Specifically, highly extrinsic primary participants tended to select other materialists as peers to participate in the study.",1,ssc
"Because the profits of having a large herd accrued exclusively to the individual herdsman, whereas the costs in terms of exceeding the carrying capacity of the common were incurred collectively by all herdsmen, each herdsman could gain wealth by grazing increasingly large herds on the common.",2,ssc
"The 'degree of imperfection' of this information clearly increases with the size of the group, because it becomes increasingly difficult to decompose the responses of other subjects into their reactions to the simultaneous changes in the contributions of their counterparts.",2,ssc
"This impression was reinforced by pair-wise comparisons indicating that participants who underwent the TÀ treatment on study day 1, and who showed relatively reduced number of cooperative responses, significantly increased their cooperative responses after the T + treatment on study day 2, while participants who underwent the T + treatment on day 1 showed similarly high levels of cooperation on day 2.",3,ssc
", because we did not expect impressions to play an important role as an antecedent of cooperative decision-making and cooperative behavior is rather the result of the direct influence of SVO (Heon individuals) or primes (Leon individuals), we did not expect a systematic relationship between cooperative behavior and impressions (Hypothesis 6).",1,ssc
"The present findings complement this growing literature by showing that people are actually willing to forgive an incident of noise, as long as the partner communicates about noise and clarifies the actual (benign) intentions.",2,ssc
"Here we present a theory of why (and for whom) intuition favors cooperation: cooperation is typically advantageous in everyday life, leading to the formation of generalized cooperative intuitions.",3,ssc
We show that these rules induce behavior that has pro-social consequences even in cases where there are strong conflicts of interests among group members and where interactions with free information exchange fail.,3,ssc
"The reasoning is that in high-trust societies, most people already contribute to the public good: The belief that most others can be trusted renders punishment an unnecessary cost to encourage contributions.",3,ssc
Punishment is generally lower when the target was the highest contributor in the group and this effect is stronger for actual than for requested punishment.,3,ssc
Threat was introduced by providing one or both subjects with a salient punitive capability in the form of a gate which could be closed by one subject to prevent access to the one-lane road.,2,ssc
"Subjects who did not see the pool size drop tended to vote against the elimination of free access to the commons, whereas subjects who did see their pool size drop voted to relinquish free access.",2,ssc
"This earlier experience, we find, causes the players to update their expectations, leading more groups to choose the tipping game compared to the treatment in which groups lack this experience.",3,ssc
When communication within teams is possible communication is an efficient means to coordinate team members' efforts at higher levels and to reduce the free-rider problem within teams.,3,ssc
"If imperfect information reduces the incentive to match others' contributions, both the matching rates of actors with relatively high marginal benefit functions and those with relatively low marginal benefit functions will tend to fall.",1,ssc
We propose that it is because task-related and task-unrelated communications activate different norms.,3,ssc
"Evidence suggests that friendships are impaired by social anxiety disorder (SAD) (Rodebaugh, 2009).",3,ssc
The conventional result of increasing reciprocity with increasing sender's trust is clearly the case for strongly pro-social individuals.,3,ssc
"In line with these predictions, Pellegrini & Long (2002) have observed an initial increase in aggressive competition as adolescents moved from primary to secondary school, and bullying behavior appeared to mediate dominance status during this transition.",3,ssc
"In 2001, the Court ruled in United States v. United Foods, Inc. the mushroom checkoff program unconstitutional because it was a stand-alone checkoff advertising program and not part of a broader set of economic regulations.",3,ssc
The binary-choice is used because there is no a priori way of determining whether a second decider will interpret a given level of cooperation by the first decider in the continuous cooperation/sequential version as 'cooperative' or 'non-cooperative'.,2,ssc
"The resulting increase in group distinctiveness can be expected to affect group perceptions (Spears et al., 1985;Acorn et al., 1988;fcfonnell et al., 1994) and ingroup favoritism should generally increase with salience of the ingroup (see the meta-analysis by Mullen et al., 1992).",2,ssc
"Namely, at the end of a repeated public good contribution game, if a surprise announcement is made that the same group of subjects will play another repeated game, contributions initially jump back to a relatively high level and then decrease again over time.",2,ssc
"Lastly, because greedy people are never satisfied with their current state of affairs, it is likely that this affects their wellbeing in a negative way.",1,ssc
"As a consequence, confounding effects such as reputation building through punishment or strategic reasons for punishing to increase cooperation in repeated interactions, as shown by Gächter et al. (2004) and Gächter and Herrmann (2009), can be excluded and a clear theoretical benchmark for standard preferences can be derived.",3,ssc
"This was because, in the case of Colombia, their subsistence depends on the fishery, which is not ecologically productive.",2,ssc
"However, when access is equally distributed, group members will be more willing to act in a way that advances the interests of the group rather than just their own (i.e., they will be more cooperative).",3,ssc
It might be speculated that even greater manipulation of partner characteristics (perhaps established via pre-experiment communication with a stooge-partner) would affect the game strategies themselves.,2,ssc
"As to the control variables, the number of members is significant and negative, indicating that groups with more members are less likely to be in the zero delinquency category.",3,ssc
"A second and related implication is that when the CPR range ␤ Ϫ ␣ increases beyond a certain threshold, the individual requests will increase too.",3,ssc
Conducting the experiments in the structured and formal setting of an experimental laboratory decreases cooperation among our subjects.,3,ssc
"In the absence of external cooperative incentives, people often choose to rely selectively on others with whom they share a group membership (e.g., Brewer, 2000Brewer, , 2008;;Packer & Kugler, 2017).",1,ssc
This improves the earnings for those groups but the lowest earnings are not too different and this pulls the overall average earnings down to look more similar across treatments.,3,ssc
"Thus, moral judgments were an effective and efficient mechanism for fostering cooperation, solidarity, generosity, trust, and trustworthiness.",3,ssc
Allowing individuals to punish their peers for socially bad behavior can improve cooperation in groups and sometimes allow them to achieve more efficient outcomes in social dilemmas by instilling positive social norms (Ostrom 1990;Fehr and Gaechter 2000;Chaudhuri 2011 provides a recent survey).,2,ssc
An important consequence of this increase in average effort is that the aggregate monetary payoff increases by 40% even if one takes the payoff reductions that result from actual punishments into account.,3,ssc
"ecause sacrifice increases the relative price of private production, it can screen freeriders from high-sacrifice groups while inducing the H-types to substitute towards more group investment.",3,ssc
"The greater are others' contributions, the less is one rewarded, ceteris paribus -perhaps because there is little scope for either punishing or rewarding in groups in which all are contributing close to the maximum.",3,ssc
The amount of communication allowed in a game thus appears to be a decisive factor in clarifying and specifying the contradictory evidence on sex differences in cooperation.,2,ssc
"In the context of the present experiment, the conjecture of ""indecision by indifference"" would imply that subjects that are quoted a monetary reward that is sufficiently close to their maximum willingness to pay would find the decision more difficult and therefore require more time for a decision.",2,ssc
"Because the cooperate-cooperate outcome produces more wealth than any other, optional entry will increase social welfare.",3,ssc
"Similarly, a pro-social subject (again defined by his decisions in the experimental choice set) would tend to make slower selfish decisions and faster pro-social decisions.",1,ssc
"First, despite the asymmetric nature of the best-shot provision technology, heterogeneity can help overcome coordination problems by providing focal points as a coordination tool.",2,ssc
Locus of control fosters cooperation for internals with high levels of cooperative education because those people are able to use their background as a means towards an end in that they believe that they can influence their desired outcomes.,3,ssc
"In addition, results from the laboratory experiments reveal that subjects donate less when they are aware that an individual could have announced support but chose not to do so.",2,ssc
Participants cooperated more when OP received higher rewards.,3,ssc
"Specifically, we expect authority contribution leaders to give more than randomly selected contribution leaders both because they recognize the positive influence that they can exert on others and because more of the mechanisms that make contribution leaders influential may be relevant when a local authority leads.",2,ssc
"Considering the relatively smaller groups (4 and 10 persons), they find that size only matters when the return on the public good is low, in which case, contributions actually increase in large groups.",2,ssc
Behavior in the experiment will support the hypothesis that moral opinions are conditional on the behavior of others if subjects report personal normative beliefs increasing in the average contribution level of group members.,2,ssc
"It is now well established that imagined contact can facilitate more positive intergroup attitudes and friendship-related emotions (Crisp & Turner, 2009).",2,ssc
"Observed individual differences in the resting cortisol levels and social memory performance under the social stress condition may be due to individual differences in HPA reactivity, personality traits, and the level of GR/MR expression in the hippocampus [10].",1,ssc
It was our expectation that news stories reporting events which were caused by human agents would temporarily influence a subject's beliefs about the surrounding social universe and hence affect his behavior toward and expectation of the presumed stranger with whom he was paired in the nonzero sum game.,2,ssc
"In these experiments, which allow subjects to punish non-cooperators at a cost to themselves, the moderate levels of contribution typically observed in early play often rise in subsequent rounds to near the maximal level rather than declining to insubstantial levels, as in the case where no punishment is permitted.",3,ssc
The paying taxes label should then lead to contributions comparable to those participants who do not spontaneously associate the public goods game with teamwork.,3,ssc
"Fear is associated with the goal to avoid risk, which in a social dilemma induces a tendency to avoid exploitation or loss.",2,ssc
"Consequently, the payoffs of free-riders in SFI decrease and over the periods, participants in SFI experience the typically observed collapse of cooperation in repeated social dilemma interactions (Fig. 1).",3,ssc
"The persistence of identity activation may depend on many things, including the strength and complexity of the initial activating cue and the presence of other identity-congruent cues in the environment.",2,ssc
"Alternately (or additionally) she may value the public good or charity itself and, believing that contribution levels are strategic complements, give more to influence others to give more.",2,ssc
The refined approach builds on key tenets of social identity theory to argue that identity affects cooperation by leadings actors to maximize ingroup outcomes and minimize ingroup inequalities.,3,ssc
"As one can see, accounting for the treatment effect of the incentives inherent in these jobs further reduces the differences in the job category point estimates.",3,ssc
"It is the product of an evolutionary game in which intragroup cooperation enhances one's reputation within the group (Yamagishi & Mifune, 2008).",3,ssc
"This is because probability theory will predict that individuals will not allocate higher weight to any particular numbers, because the probability of winning should be the same for all numbers.",1,ssc
"By taking the view that a confluence of individual and contextual factors induces aggressive behavior, we explore how individual proclivities for aggression and environmental circumstances conducive to aggression e neither of which are particularly rare in isolation e must co-occur to create the comparatively rare expression of aggressive behavior.",2,ssc
"Under naturally occurring circumstances, search costs and switching costs, as well as fluctuations in individual performance, tend to delay regrouping.",1,ssc
The first conjecture refers to the potentially positive effect that leadership signaling per se may have in catalyzing cooperation.,2,ssc
The inclusion of asynchrony allowed a player to act independently of his opponent; this provided an opportunity to double-cross him.,3,ssc
"It relies on the idea that people react to unfair intentions by sacrificing a part of their payoffs in order to punish others, even when there are no reputation gains from doing so (Rabin 1993;Falk and Fischbacher 2006).",3,ssc
"A possible explanation is that the cooperation norm is more salient in the former than in the latter, due to the fact that in ""public,"" everyone observes punishments for norm violations.",3,ssc
Our findings also showed that participants' scores on a Prosocial value domain derived from Rokeach's terminal values were indicative of their cooperation preferences in the PGGs.,1,ssc
