"Large coalitions mean few outsiders but, at the same time, high free-rider benefits if the coalition members fully internalize their mutual benefits.",3,ssc
"In our study, by perceiving the punishment executer to be human, we show that such a rule could emerge spontaneously because the rule benefits the punishment executers themselves.",3,ssc
"Cook and her colleagues examined another condition of PD/D in which two players were randomly matched in each trial, and found that the positive effect of the opportunity to separate trust and cooperation provided by the PD/D requires that the game be played between particular partners repeatedly.",3,ssc
Isaac and Walker (1988b) present experimental evidence that the ability to talk among group members participating in a public goods game leads to increased cooperation in the form of higher contributions and lower free-riding.,3,ssc

"When people perceive a relationship partner as highly agreeable, they feel more comfortable resolving conflicts (Jensen-Campbell et al., 2002) and are more inclined to solve conflicts through informal mechanisms (rather than including a third-party mediator; Morris, Leung, & Iyengar, 2004).",2,ssc
"Alternatively, motivational factors may diminish children's cooperative reasoning and actions in the face of personal costs.",2,ssc

"The very existence of a government that can promulgate and enforce regulations to deter free riding while acting as a faithful agent of its citizens depends on voluntary pro-social acts such as citizen scrutiny of politicians' actions, self-education about political issues, and making the effort to vote in elections.",2,ssc
The results suggest that remembering an experience of rejection can trigger anger and ruminating on being rejected can trigger indirect aggression.,1,ssc

"Individually rational and selfish behavior thus leads to Pareto-suboptimal outcomes, rendering the one-shot PD a classic example of a social dilemma [1,2].",3,ssc
"As actors participate in the production of public goods, processes of social comparison may affect the decisions about the individual contributions as well as the endogenously changing structure of an underlying social network.",2,ssc

"If the memory advantage for expectancy-incongruent information is abolished under cognitive load, our ability to successfully engage in social cooperation would be impaired because this type of memory is essential for correcting maladaptive behavior tendencies.",2,ssc
"This leads to a 'fairness' scenario in which the wealth of richer subjects is invested in their local network, allowing poorer neighbours to gain wealth.",3,ssc
People who sacrifice on behalf of others like themselves are more prone to the self-interest illusion because they see the benefits as going to people who are like themselves in some salient way.,3,ssc
A natural explanation for the limited capability of a leader's signal to influence followers' beliefs under heterogeneity is the lack of followers' trust in the relevance of the signal to participants who do not share the religion of the leader.,3,ssc

There is some experimental evidence that groups are better off when punishment is delivered by a central agency than when group members sanction each other (O'GORMAN et al. 2009).,1,ssc
This result suggests that language activates group norms in a heterogeneous fashion: if different people's latent identities differ they can respond in very different ways to identical linguistic cues.,1,ssc
"The second insight is that the inefficiency observed in heterogeneous groups is not only due to the inefficiently low levels of contribution, but also due to a relative underuse of rewards.",3,ssc
"Of primary interest in this context is the latter interaction: block-ofrcd subjects who had participated first in the Paddle Game declined less in cooperativeness than those who had not, and tit-for-tat subjects with prior Paddle Game experience increased more in cooperativeness over trials than those without such experience.",3,ssc
This allowed them to condition their minimum proposal on the size of the coalition such that the internalization ratios a(k) may depend on the coalition size.,2,ssc
"Secondly, the experience of conflict may create or deepen ingroup identity, strengthening other-regarding preferences toward in-group members and making it more attractive to cooperate within groups.",2,ssc
"Our broad conclusion is that, while social desirability matters, the way it matters subtly depends on the social desirability personality type, and this in turn affects the social and experimental perceptions of what is demanded.",3,ssc

"We found that when people's mortality was not called to their attention, a need-focused appeal had more influence on their donation decisions than a bandwagon appeal.",3,ssc
"For the present purposes, we opted against counterbalancing, due to the demands that this would have placed on the number of different sequential arrangements, as well as a balanced distribution of young and old girls and boys.",3,ssc

"The increase in average contributions for the US region in RN (29.8) relative to ON (26.7) is due to the fact that, in ON, 64% of American participants opted for the principles of future polluter-pays and equal percentage reduction of current  emissions, both of which are synonymous with the smallest public good contribution; conversely, in RN, 62% of Chinese participants selected the principles of equal per capita entitlement to emissions and historical polluter-pays, the equity principles that denote the largest contributions for the US region.",3,ssc

"While the behavior of subjects in the low-reward conditions is more ambiguous, it is congruent with the speculation that persons are not highly motivated to do well in the PD game when earnings are small, irrespective of the extent to which the rewards are equitable.",3,ssc
"It may well be that if a group fails in establishing the public good, a self-sacrificing leader may be evaluated as poor since his or her efforts did not prevent the group from failing.",2,ssc
"Although punishment may be used to regulate the members of the in-group, the evidence presented here suggests that it is often driven by intergroup biasleading to harsher punishment of out-group members.",2,ssc
The original MGE had a strong effect because it involved allocation of tangible rewards; this implies that mere categorization produces discriminative behavior.,3,ssc
"Clearly, the salience of social categories may be important in order to create cooperation within groups (e.g.",2,ssc
People may voluntarily contribute to a public good because they feel morally obligated to assist others in a common cause or because they realize that contributing will help the group as a whole.,2,ssc
Subjects' reaction to punishment suggests that earnings feedback affects negatively their expectations about the contribution of their peers in the following period.,2,ssc
This unpredicted interaction may have happened due to collectiveness created by the community title.,2,ssc
