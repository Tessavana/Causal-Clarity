Both effects should cause increase in public-good provision at least at level 1.,1,0,Ssc
"Further, because direct reciprocity was not possible in our experiments, sharing arrangements were not self-enforcing.",1,0,Ssc
"Thus, much like the real world, if harvesters mismanaged the resource during the early stages of the simulation, there was less available during the later stages.",1,0,Ssc
Previous research has shown that behavior aligns with self-interest only when self-interest is salient.,1,0,Ssc
"Because of the partner design, this yields 18 independent observations for each treatment.",1,0,Ssc
"Otherwise, if the accumulated gain explains the behaviour of the birds but the one trial gain does not, then the birds are making decisions based on the four trial reward and are playing a mutualism game.",1,0,Ssc
This effect would be due primarily to the significantly lower amount of cooperation for subjects assigned to the low potential reward position.,0,1,Ssc
The present results indicate that the failure might not be due to an unrepresentativeness of game situations to typical interpersonal interactions.,0,1,Ssc
"The correlation between contributions and other-team beliefs is lower (Spearman's = 0.31, p < 0.01), but still indicative of a positive relationship.",0,1,Ssc
"First, we can assess the correlation between beliefs and contributions, which we expect to differ between types of players and which helps us to check on the player type as elicited in the P-experiment.",0,1,Ssc
"And the more a participant contributes, the less he or she earns.",0,1,Ssc
"The follow-up independent t-tests (Table 1) revealed that MAOA-L carriers exhibited significantly lower beliefs about others' contribution in stage one (P~0:013), stage two (P~0:037), and stage three (P~0:039), but not in stage four (P~0:421).",0,1,Ssc
The negative trend in contributions in blue groups is substantial and statistically significant.,0,1,Ssc
"However, if categorization does impact trust, why did S. L. Gaertner and Rust's (2000) study and our pilot studies fail to find a significant effect of categorization manipulations on PDG choices?",0,1,Ssc
"Unconditional contribution impacts negatively the probability of being leader, but this result is not robust and is significant only at the 10 % level. 14",0,1,Ssc
"A linear regression with random effects with RT as the dependent variable shows a marginally significant effect of SVO (B ¼ À0.58, 95% CI [À1.27 to 0.11], P value ¼ 0.1), and a significant effect of trial number (B ¼ À0.01, 95% CI [À0.011 to À0.0091], P value < 0.001, Wald v 2 ¼ 413.20).",0,1,Ssc
"Using Campbell's (1958) concept of `entitativity', they also assume that the competitive discontinuity between individuals and groups is greater the more members Discontinuity or reciprocity?",0,1,Ssc
"Fourth, cooperation and trust are not related to affiliation tendencies, but strongly related to betrayal aversion.",0,1,Ssc
