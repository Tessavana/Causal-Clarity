The gains or losses incurred by the players on each trial are dependent on choices made by both of them between two available behaviors.,3,1,ssc
"Both the Outcome for Others and the Equality of Outcomes depend on others, meaning when the total group is greater than two people, these others' properties are combinations of multiple people's behaviors, not just a single individual's behavior.",1,2,ssc
"Thus, because an elected leader refl ects the choice of the group and its members, an elected leader will feel strong support from the followers who will bestow on the leader a high sense of social responsibility ( Julian, Hollander, & Regula, 1969;Kenney et al., 1996).",3,1,ssc
The amount of communication allowed in a game thus appears to be a decisive factor in clarifying and specifying the contradictory evidence on sex differences in cooperation.,2,3,ssc
But since the payoff for mutual defection is smaller than the payoff for mutual cooperation (fwo) the dilemma arises on what to choose if having in mind also the welfare of the society and not just personal interests.,2,1,ssc
"When everyone has made a choice, the outcome and the choices of the other members of your committee are revealed, and this determines your earnings for the match.",3,1,ssc
"Fear is associated with the goal to avoid risk, which in a social dilemma induces a tendency to avoid exploitation or loss.",2,3,ssc
"Interacting with others in large populations without structure greatly reduces the likelihood of cooperation (11), but in a fixed social network cooperation can evolve as a consequence of repeated interactions because of ""social viscosity,"" even in the absence of reputation effects or strategic complexity (1,2).",3,2,ssc
"But you should also be careful not to ask for too much, because if at the end of the study everyone's requests add up to more than the $1,000 that is in the pool, then nobody, including yourself, will receive anything.",2,3,ssc
"The maintenance of social norms often depends on external enforcement, as in the absence of credible sanctioning mechanisms prosocial behaviour deteriorates quickly.",3,2,ssc
"We predicted that in absence of a sanctioning system, people would show little support for a sanctioning system unless there is collective inefficiency, and that in presence of a sanctioning system, people would support the sanctioning system, irre-spective of the information people have concerning collective (in)efficiency.",2,1,ssc
"In the context of the present experiment, the conjecture of ""indecision by indifference"" would imply that subjects that are quoted a monetary reward that is sufficiently close to their maximum willingness to pay would find the decision more difficult and therefore require more time for a decision.",2,3,ssc
"At the opposite, people do not have a strong adverse reaction to external regulation and follow the elected rules because there is a general and specific trust that others will also follow the rules.",3,1,ssc
"In two behavioral experiments, we offer individuals the latter possibility: Participants can work together to increase the total size of the pie and hence increase the size of their own slice.",2,1,ssc
"We find that contributions are 56.6% higher when group composition is different across both public goods dilemmas as compared to when composition is the same across the two public goods dilemmas (M 1 = 17.7,",3,1,ssc
"When the objective incentives remain identical, these studies showed that framing the dilemma in terms of ""taking from"" instead of ""contributing to"" increases cooperation (Brewer and Kramer, 1986).",3,1,ssc
These results suggest that the shared outcomes involved in cooperation did increase cohesiveness.,3,2,ssc
"In contrast, increasing individuals' awareness of their mortality apparently leads them to base their donation decisions on the social desirability of providing help, as reflected in the amount of help provided in the past (Experiments 1-3) and others' preferences (Experiment 4).",3,2,ssc
The consequence of these two evolutionary forces is that in equilibrium strong reciprocators and purely selfish humans coexist.,1,3,ssc
There are indications that the unequal range of pay-off accelerated the observed trends rather than reversing them.,2,3,ssc
"The institutional mechanism implemented in Study 1 is richer than an ultimatum game and simultaneously changes the incentive structure depending on the priors of the participants: if players believe that others will contribute at levels just above the lowest current contributor, and believe that others believe this, pure self-interest will generate the observed ratchet pattern.",2,3,ssc
It is possible that people's ability to estimate the equal choice may decrease as the number of others with whom they are sharing a nonpartitioned resource increases.,2,1,ssc
"Information enables players to decide whether to trust the others in the group and cooperate, once they are aware that cooperation can achieve a superior outcome.",2,3,ssc
"Replications with people from other age groups or nations would help to establish the generalizability of these findings, which is important to do because researchers have suggested that apologies and offers of compensation are species-typical ways of promoting forgiveness (e.g., fcfullough, 2008;fcfullough, Kurzban, et al., 2010).",1,2,ssc
"As a consequence, confounding effects such as reputation building through punishment or strategic reasons for punishing to increase cooperation in repeated interactions, as shown by Gächter et al. (2004) and Gächter and Herrmann (2009), can be excluded and a clear theoretical benchmark for standard preferences can be derived.",1,3,ssc
"Furthermore, the highest contributor in the group earned more prestige when the good was unattainable, suggesting an association between status and conspicuous cooperation (Hypothesis 3).",1,2,ssc
"Fear is associated with the goal to avoid risk, which in a social dilemma induces a tendency to avoid exploitation or loss.",1,3,ssc
The employers appeal to the strong reciprocity of the workers by being more generous as  the desired effort level becomes more costly to the worker.,3,1,ssc
"As such, people from different societies will tend to express different preferences and beliefs: one should be able to measure between-group variation.",2,1,ssc
We show that these rules induce behavior that has pro-social consequences even in cases where there are strong conflicts of interests among group members and where interactions with free information exchange fail.,3,2,ssc
Tooby & Cosmides (1996) propose that the establishment of stable and friendly relationships between group members favoured the exchange of help when needed and thus reduced the risks of the situation described by the banker's paradox.,3,2,ssc
"Because of the partner design, this yields 18 independent observations for each treatment.",3,1,ssc
"Such patrols not only deter free riding in itself but also generate information needed for the punishment of free riders, which is determined by an executive committee on the group level chaired by the group leader.",2,1,ssc
"If a player died during a wave, the character would respawn during the next wave.",2,3,ssc
Bargainers with a significant threat tend to threaten and fine more often.,2,3,ssc
"If both firms opt for the low Nash equilibrium price, though, market-level profits and wages will be minimized.",3,2,ssc
The fothfun mechanism thus leads to less cooperation than in the baseline case with no punishment if the detrimental effect of retaliatory punishment is greater than the positive norm-enforcing effect of punishment.,2,3,ssc
"However, if each individual attempts to maximize his or her self-interest, the collective outcome will be less desirable than if each individual attempts to maximize the collective interest (Dawes, 1980).",3,2,ssc
"However, because condition SQ6 is played after the subject gains much experience with the task, and in particular after experiencing the fifth position in condition SQ5, we anticipate fewer violations of the model in condition SQ6 than in condition SQ in experiment 1. METHOD Subjects.",2,3,ssc
"In the game, a leader usually emerged and the leader's pleadings for cooperation were harder to ignore because all the players had experienced the results of greedy play.",3,1,ssc
"This was because, in the case of Colombia, their subsistence depends on the fishery, which is not ecologically productive.",2,1,ssc
"In other words, a dictator is more likely to make a fair offer if he/she expects the audience to observe their choice.",1,2,ssc
"However, there are also reasons to think that the treatment will lead to low contributions, since the reaction to the comprehension/advice combination may be defensive.",2,1,ssc
