"Cook and her colleagues examined another condition of PD/D in which two players were randomly matched in each trial, and found that the positive effect of the opportunity to separate trust and cooperation provided by the PD/D requires that the game be played between particular partners repeatedly.",2,1,ssc
"As a consequence, confounding effects such as reputation building through punishment or strategic reasons for punishing to increase cooperation in repeated interactions, as shown by Gächter et al. (2004) and Gächter and Herrmann (2009), can be excluded and a clear theoretical benchmark for standard preferences can be derived.",0,2,ssc
