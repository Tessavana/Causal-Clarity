", because we did not expect impressions to play an important role as an antecedent of cooperative decision-making and cooperative behavior is rather the result of the direct influence of SVO (Heon individuals) or primes (Leon individuals), we did not expect a systematic relationship between cooperative behavior and impressions (Hypothesis 6).",0,1
The gains or losses incurred by the players on each trial are dependent on choices made by both of them between two available behaviors.,2,1
"Both the Outcome for Others and the Equality of Outcomes depend on others, meaning when the total group is greater than two people, these others' properties are combinations of multiple people's behaviors, not just a single individual's behavior.",0,1
"Otherwise, if the accumulated gain explains the behaviour of the birds but the one trial gain does not, then the birds are making decisions based on the four trial reward and are playing a mutualism game.",1,2
But since the payoff for mutual defection is smaller than the payoff for mutual cooperation (fwo) the dilemma arises on what to choose if having in mind also the welfare of the society and not just personal interests.,1,2
"Fear is associated with the goal to avoid risk, which in a social dilemma induces a tendency to avoid exploitation or loss.",1,2
"Interacting with others in large populations without structure greatly reduces the likelihood of cooperation (11), but in a fixed social network cooperation can evolve as a consequence of repeated interactions because of ""social viscosity,"" even in the absence of reputation effects or strategic complexity (1,2).",2,1
"Of course, second graders also shift to A2 or B2 choices, and as soon as one player does so, the chances are high for retaliation on the part of the other.",1,2
"Inversely, (2) when students have academic curricula with high levels of background knowledge related to the root causes of environmental problems and the related possible strategic options, the cooperative-competitive context does not matter.",2,1
"But you should also be careful not to ask for too much, because if at the end of the study everyone's requests add up to more than the $1,000 that is in the pool, then nobody, including yourself, will receive anything.",1,2
"The maintenance of social norms often depends on external enforcement, as in the absence of credible sanctioning mechanisms prosocial behaviour deteriorates quickly.",2,1
"In two behavioral experiments, we offer individuals the latter possibility: Participants can work together to increase the total size of the pie and hence increase the size of their own slice.",1,2
The inclusion of asynchrony allowed a player to act independently of his opponent; this provided an opportunity to double-cross him.,2,1
"In many social-game protocols, ranging from gift-exchange over ultimatum bargaining to public-good situations, human behaviour differs substantially from the Nash-equilibrium that results if we assume that players care only about their own monetary payoff.",2,1
"Considering the relatively smaller groups (4 and 10 persons), they find that size only matters when the return on the public good is low, in which case, contributions actually increase in large groups.",1,2
"The institutional mechanism implemented in Study 1 is richer than an ultimatum game and simultaneously changes the incentive structure depending on the priors of the participants: if players believe that others will contribute at levels just above the lowest current contributor, and believe that others believe this, pure self-interest will generate the observed ratchet pattern.",2,1
These results suggest that the shared outcomes involved in cooperation did increase cohesiveness.,2,1
"In contrast, increasing individuals' awareness of their mortality apparently leads them to base their donation decisions on the social desirability of providing help, as reflected in the amount of help provided in the past (Experiments 1-3) and others' preferences (Experiment 4).",2,1
The consequence of these two evolutionary forces is that in equilibrium strong reciprocators and purely selfish humans coexist.,0,2
There are indications that the unequal range of pay-off accelerated the observed trends rather than reversing them.,1,0
"Replications with people from other age groups or nations would help to establish the generalizability of these findings, which is important to do because researchers have suggested that apologies and offers of compensation are species-typical ways of promoting forgiveness (e.g., fcfullough, 2008;fcfullough, Kurzban, et al., 2010).",0,1
"As a consequence, confounding effects such as reputation building through punishment or strategic reasons for punishing to increase cooperation in repeated interactions, as shown by Gächter et al. (2004) and Gächter and Herrmann (2009), can be excluded and a clear theoretical benchmark for standard preferences can be derived.",0,1
"Furthermore, the highest contributor in the group earned more prestige when the good was unattainable, suggesting an association between status and conspicuous cooperation (Hypothesis 3).",0,2
"Fear is associated with the goal to avoid risk, which in a social dilemma induces a tendency to avoid exploitation or loss.",0,2
"As such, people from different societies will tend to express different preferences and beliefs: one should be able to measure between-group variation.",1,0
"This is because probability theory will predict that individuals will not allocate higher weight to any particular numbers, because the probability of winning should be the same for all numbers.",2,0
"Such patrols not only deter free riding in itself but also generate information needed for the punishment of free riders, which is determined by an executive committee on the group level chaired by the group leader.",1,2
Bargainers with a significant threat tend to threaten and fine more often.,0,2
""" 5 contexts lead actors to rely more on contributions to the group than competitive contexts, while competitive contexts lead actors to rely more on punishment of others than cooperative contexts.",2,1
Bargainers with a significant threat tend to threaten and fine more often.,1,2
The discrepant levels of attention paid to music in relation to consumer behavior and employee or organizational behavior are most clear when considering retail workspaces because (i) customers and employees cohabit the locations and (ii) it is reasonable to expect that music that is selected to influence the behaviors of customers would have similar influences on employees.,0,1
More intelligent subjects were significantly more likely to vote for whichever of FS or IS was associated with higher earnings ex post.,0,2
The fothfun mechanism thus leads to less cooperation than in the baseline case with no punishment if the detrimental effect of retaliatory punishment is greater than the positive norm-enforcing effect of punishment.,1,2
"Due to the missing information on individual evasion of other group members, there is no potential for a contagion effect in the baseline treatment.",2,1
"However, if each individual attempts to maximize his or her self-interest, the collective outcome will be less desirable than if each individual attempts to maximize the collective interest (Dawes, 1980).",2,1
"However, because condition SQ6 is played after the subject gains much experience with the task, and in particular after experiencing the fifth position in condition SQ5, we anticipate fewer violations of the model in condition SQ6 than in condition SQ in experiment 1. METHOD Subjects.",1,2
"In the game, a leader usually emerged and the leader's pleadings for cooperation were harder to ignore because all the players had experienced the results of greedy play.",2,1
