", because we did not expect impressions to play an important role as an antecedent of cooperative decision-making and cooperative behavior is rather the result of the direct influence of SVO (Heon individuals) or primes (Leon individuals), we did not expect a systematic relationship between cooperative behavior and impressions (Hypothesis 6).",0,2
The gains or losses incurred by the players on each trial are dependent on choices made by both of them between two available behaviors.,2,0
"Both the Outcome for Others and the Equality of Outcomes depend on others, meaning when the total group is greater than two people, these others' properties are combinations of multiple people's behaviors, not just a single individual's behavior.",0,1
"Otherwise, if the accumulated gain explains the behaviour of the birds but the one trial gain does not, then the birds are making decisions based on the four trial reward and are playing a mutualism game.",1,0
But since the payoff for mutual defection is smaller than the payoff for mutual cooperation (fwo) the dilemma arises on what to choose if having in mind also the welfare of the society and not just personal interests.,1,0
"Fear is associated with the goal to avoid risk, which in a social dilemma induces a tendency to avoid exploitation or loss.",1,2
"Of course, second graders also shift to A2 or B2 choices, and as soon as one player does so, the chances are high for retaliation on the part of the other.",1,2
"But you should also be careful not to ask for too much, because if at the end of the study everyone's requests add up to more than the $1,000 that is in the pool, then nobody, including yourself, will receive anything.",1,2
"In two behavioral experiments, we offer individuals the latter possibility: Participants can work together to increase the total size of the pie and hence increase the size of their own slice.",1,2
"In many social-game protocols, ranging from gift-exchange over ultimatum bargaining to public-good situations, human behaviour differs substantially from the Nash-equilibrium that results if we assume that players care only about their own monetary payoff.",2,0
"Considering the relatively smaller groups (4 and 10 persons), they find that size only matters when the return on the public good is low, in which case, contributions actually increase in large groups.",1,2
"The institutional mechanism implemented in Study 1 is richer than an ultimatum game and simultaneously changes the incentive structure depending on the priors of the participants: if players believe that others will contribute at levels just above the lowest current contributor, and believe that others believe this, pure self-interest will generate the observed ratchet pattern.",2,1
"The contextual effects caused by the mean, range, and rank of the distribution confirmed our expectations that these relativity effects are due to some general underlying cognitive mechanisms.",2,0
These results suggest that the shared outcomes involved in cooperation did increase cohesiveness.,2,1
"In contrast, increasing individuals' awareness of their mortality apparently leads them to base their donation decisions on the social desirability of providing help, as reflected in the amount of help provided in the past (Experiments 1-3) and others' preferences (Experiment 4).",2,1
The consequence of these two evolutionary forces is that in equilibrium strong reciprocators and purely selfish humans coexist.,0,2
There are indications that the unequal range of pay-off accelerated the observed trends rather than reversing them.,1,0
"Replications with people from other age groups or nations would help to establish the generalizability of these findings, which is important to do because researchers have suggested that apologies and offers of compensation are species-typical ways of promoting forgiveness (e.g., fcfullough, 2008;fcfullough, Kurzban, et al., 2010).",0,1
"Cook and her colleagues examined another condition of PD/D in which two players were randomly matched in each trial, and found that the positive effect of the opportunity to separate trust and cooperation provided by the PD/D requires that the game be played between particular partners repeatedly.",2,1
"As a consequence, confounding effects such as reputation building through punishment or strategic reasons for punishing to increase cooperation in repeated interactions, as shown by Gächter et al. (2004) and Gächter and Herrmann (2009), can be excluded and a clear theoretical benchmark for standard preferences can be derived.",0,2
"Furthermore, the highest contributor in the group earned more prestige when the good was unattainable, suggesting an association between status and conspicuous cooperation (Hypothesis 3).",0,2
"Fear is associated with the goal to avoid risk, which in a social dilemma induces a tendency to avoid exploitation or loss.",0,2
"As such, people from different societies will tend to express different preferences and beliefs: one should be able to measure between-group variation.",1,0
"This is because probability theory will predict that individuals will not allocate higher weight to any particular numbers, because the probability of winning should be the same for all numbers.",2,0
"Such patrols not only deter free riding in itself but also generate information needed for the punishment of free riders, which is determined by an executive committee on the group level chaired by the group leader.",1,2
""" 5 contexts lead actors to rely more on contributions to the group than competitive contexts, while competitive contexts lead actors to rely more on punishment of others than cooperative contexts.",2,1
Bargainers with a significant threat tend to threaten and fine more often.,1,0
The discrepant levels of attention paid to music in relation to consumer behavior and employee or organizational behavior are most clear when considering retail workspaces because (i) customers and employees cohabit the locations and (ii) it is reasonable to expect that music that is selected to influence the behaviors of customers would have similar influences on employees.,0,1
More intelligent subjects were significantly more likely to vote for whichever of FS or IS was associated with higher earnings ex post.,0,2
The fothfun mechanism thus leads to less cooperation than in the baseline case with no punishment if the detrimental effect of retaliatory punishment is greater than the positive norm-enforcing effect of punishment.,1,2
"However, if each individual attempts to maximize his or her self-interest, the collective outcome will be less desirable than if each individual attempts to maximize the collective interest (Dawes, 1980).",2,1
"However, because condition SQ6 is played after the subject gains much experience with the task, and in particular after experiencing the fifth position in condition SQ5, we anticipate fewer violations of the model in condition SQ6 than in condition SQ in experiment 1. METHOD Subjects.",1,2
"This was because, in the case of Colombia, their subsistence depends on the fishery, which is not ecologically productive.",1,2
"These were participants with little or no experience from economic games, because, according to the SHH, there will be a negative deliberation effect on cooperation only for subjects with limited experience from economic games and other ""artificial lab environments"" (Rand et al., 2014).",1,2
