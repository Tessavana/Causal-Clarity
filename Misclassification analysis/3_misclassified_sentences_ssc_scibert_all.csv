Our studies suggest that sometimes coordination can be easily promoted by simply pointing out to people that certain information is available to all people involved.,1,0
"In many social-game protocols, ranging from gift-exchange over ultimatum bargaining to public-good situations, human behaviour differs substantially from the Nash-equilibrium that results if we assume that players care only about their own monetary payoff.",1,2
"Consequently, our results indicate that emoticons mainly affect behavior through the communication channel provided with it (feedback as pre-play communication).",2,0
"In two behavioral experiments, we offer individuals the latter possibility: Participants can work together to increase the total size of the pie and hence increase the size of their own slice.",1,2
"The alternative model predicts the following predictions: P 1 : When there is no tax imposed, individual contributions will exceed 5. P 2 : When a tax of 3 is imposed, total individual contributions will exceed the individual contributions made when there is no tax imposed.",1,2
It is therefore possible that the higher rates of cooperation in PD are (partly) due to the smaller size of the action set.,0,2
The fothfun mechanism thus leads to less cooperation than in the baseline case with no punishment if the detrimental effect of retaliatory punishment is greater than the positive norm-enforcing effect of punishment.,1,2
The paying taxes label should then lead to contributions comparable to those participants who do not spontaneously associate the public goods game with teamwork.,2,1

"First, models of information signaling have shown that sequential giving can have beneficial effects for voluntary public good provision when the common value of the public good is uncertain.",1,2
"The extent of individual cooperation tends to be higher among high-identifying individuals, either because they place greater value in the good itself (De Cremer & Van Vugt, in press;Kerr, 1996), because they have greater trust in the cooperative intentions of fellow group members (Brann & Foddy, 1987;Brewer & Kramer, 1986;Kramer & Brewer, 1984), or both.",0,1
"As a consequence, confounding effects such as reputation building through punishment or strategic reasons for punishing to increase cooperation in repeated interactions, as shown by Gächter et al. (2004) and Gächter and Herrmann (2009), can be excluded and a clear theoretical benchmark for standard preferences can be derived.",0,2
"In our study, by perceiving the punishment executer to be human, we show that such a rule could emerge spontaneously because the rule benefits the punishment executers themselves.",2,1
"Because the cooperate-cooperate outcome produces more wealth than any other, optional entry will increase social welfare.",2,1
"Thus, we compare people who hold the evoked identity to people who are familiar with, but who do not hold, that identity: if identity is important in the current effects, those who do not hold the evoked identity will not be affected by identity-salience manipulations.",1,2

"When players have the option of punishing each other after the contribution stage, the effect of the moral messages on contributions becomes persistent: punishments and moral messages interact to sustain cooperation.",1,2
