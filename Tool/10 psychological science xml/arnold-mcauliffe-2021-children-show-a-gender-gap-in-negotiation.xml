<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p><s>We tested 240 children between the ages of 4 and 9 years old.</s><s>To ensure a relatively even distribution across our age range, we recruited children into three predetermined age groups (4-and 5-year-olds: n = 80, M = 5.1 years, SD = 0.5, 40 female; 6-and 7-year-olds: n = 80, M = 7.1 years, SD = 0.6, 40 female; 8-and 9-yearolds: n = 80, M = 8.9 years, SD = 0.6, 40 female).</s><s>Twenty-six additional children were excluded because of prior experience with the experimenter (n = 11), refusal to continue participating (n = 8), parental interference (n = 2), lack of motivation for stickers (n = 1), extreme distraction (n = 1), not being able to count (n = 1), and experimenter error (n = 2).</s><s>Children were recruited from the Boston, Massachusetts, area and tested in public spaces (n = 238) and a laboratory setting (n = 2).</s><s>We did not collect demographic information for participants in public spaces because of constraints from the institutional review board.</s><s>Our target sample size was based on similar developmental work (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bian et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Our goal was to recruit 20 children per gender per evaluator (male or female) per age group.</s><s>We ceased data collection for a given cell when we reached our target of 20.</s><s>Two of our cells were imbalanced because of a coding error that was caught and corrected, but this meant that we had 21 participants in one cell and 19 in another (see Table <ref type="table">S1</ref> in the Supplemental Material available online).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task</head><p><s>Our task was modeled on real-life negotiations.</s><s>In real negotiations, initial requests produce an anchoring effect so that higher initial requests (within reason) result in better negotiation outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Galinsky &amp; Mussweiler, 2001)</ref>.</s><s>These tactics are especially true in settings such as negotiating for a salary bonus, in which evaluators will accept any request less than a certain amount.</s><s>Negotiators therefore need to ask for a large amount and slowly reduce their amount requested over time to increase the likelihood that they will find the maximum amount the evaluator will give them.</s><s>If negotiators ask for too little on their first request or reduce the amount requested too quickly, the evaluator will accept and keep for themselves the additional amount they would otherwise be willing to give the negotiator.</s></p><p><s>Our task mirrored these real-world negotiations in that children could ask for as many stickers as they liked in the first phase of negotiations.</s><s>Unbeknownst to the children, the evaluator would always accept requests of two stickers or fewer and would always reject requests above that threshold.</s><s>If a request was rejected, negotiations would progress to the next phase.</s><s>Therefore, our task was designed to measure both participants' initial request and how many trials they persisted in requesting more than two stickers.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p><s>Prior to participation, children completed an unrelated lab activity in which we did not examine gender or use stickers as a reward.</s><s>These activities consisted of tasks examining social and cognitive development.</s><s>Children were not given feedback about how they behaved on these tasks: They were free to make whatever decisions they wanted and to answer questions however they chose.</s><s>The majority of these tasks consisted of making decisions about resource distributions, and past work that used the same and similar paradigms as the prior activities, such as the inequity game, has revealed no systematic gender differences in behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Blake &amp; McAuliffe, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Importantly, these previous activities did not influence our results: Adding the prior activity to our main model did not improve model fitlikelihood-ratio test (LRT), χ²(1) = 6.06, p = .30</s><s>(for a replication of our main models with prior study as an additional control, see Table <ref type="table">S5</ref> in the Supplemental Material).</s></p><p><s>To begin the negotiation task, a new experimenter (the evaluator) praised children for completing the prior activity and offered stickers as a bonus prize.</s><s>The evaluator was either a man or a woman and did not have any contact with the child prior to the child's participation.</s><s>Both evaluators were fully trained, and their delivery of the script was standardized before the first participants were run.</s><s>We chose to use only one male and one female evaluator to maximize consistency both within and across evaluators and prioritized these forms of consistency over training a larger number of female and male experimenters, which would have inevitably added more noise to the procedure.</s><s>Each child picked his or her favorite type of stickers to negotiate for out of three options to ensure that all children were motivated by the prize.</s><s>Then, participants were asked the target question, "How many stickers do you think you should get for completing the game you just played?"</s><s>For this first question, children had no information about how many requested stickers the evaluator would accept or reject.</s><s>When participants requested two stickers or fewer, the evaluator accepted and the study ended.</s><s>When participants asked for more than two stickers, the evaluator said the request was too high and repeated the test question.</s><s>Therefore, if participants asked for more than two stickers at this phase, they moved on to the next part of the negotiation task.</s></p><p><s>At the start of the second phase, the evaluator explained the rules of negotiation to participants.</s><s>Participants were told that (Case 1) if they asked for more stickers than the evaluator was able to give them, they would not get any stickers, and (Case 2) if they asked for the same or a smaller number of stickers than the evaluator was able to give them, they would receive the number of stickers they asked for.</s><s>These rules were introduced to reflect the risk inherent in negotiations, in which the evaluator has all the power to accept or reject an offer.</s><s>Participants were then asked to recall what would happen in Cases 1 and 2, which we refer to as the first and second comprehension check, respectively.</s><s>Of the 154 participants who made it to the second phase, 73% passed the first comprehension check, and 82% passed the second comprehension check.</s><s>All participants who failed were reminded of the rules again.</s><s>Children were then reasked the target question.</s><s>If participants asked for more than two stickers after their second request, the evaluator informed the children that there were fewer than three stickers; negotiations ended after children's next request.</s><s>Children's persistence was not affected by whether they passed or failed the comprehension checks (see Table <ref type="table">S8</ref> in the Supplemental Material).</s><s>See Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> for a visualization of the negotiation task.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Coding and analysis</head><p><s>The design resulted in two dependent variables: size of initial request (observed range = 0-20) and number of trials in which children made above-threshold requests (possible range = 0-2).</s></p><p><s>Children's responses were recorded live by the primary experimenter and, where possible, later coded from video by an independent video coder.</s><s>Video and live coders agreed on 99.13% (227/229) of child responses for the initial request and 100% (229/229) for persistence.</s><s>All analyses were conducted using the statistical software R (R Core Team, 2018) and the package MASS <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Venables &amp; Ripley, 2002)</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>First, we looked at children's initial requests.</s><s>To account for the nonnormal distribution of residuals, we used a negative binomial generalized linear model with age, participant gender, and evaluator gender as our predictors.</s><s>There was a significant three-way interaction among age, participant gender, and evaluator gender, β = 0.22, SE = 0.11, odds ratio (OR) = 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [1.00,</s><s>1.55];

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Our study is the first to show that gender differences in negotiation emerge in childhood.</s><s>Older girls in our paradigm differed from boys in how much they were willing to ask for from a male evaluator, showing a striking resemblance to findings in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bowles et al., 2007)</ref>: Girls are not asking for less from both evaluators but instead are negotiating less only with the male evaluator.</s></p><p><s>Our findings add negotiation to the list of earlydeveloping gendered behaviors that may lead to and magnify the wage gap in adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bian et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Liben et al., 2001)</ref>.</s><s>For the negotiation literature broadly, our novel paradigm paves the way for exciting new work on children's negotiation behavior.</s><s>With respect to the intersection of gender and negotiation, our findings highlight middle childhood as a key period for the development of these behaviors.</s></p><p><s>There are at least two mechanisms that could account for our pattern of results and that deserve further exploration: status and stereotypes.</s><s>With respect to status, it is possible that gender differences in negotiation are driven by individuals who perceive themselves to be of lower status (here, girls) making requests from individuals who they perceive to be of higher status (here, men) and not driven by gender specifically.</s><s>With respect to stereotypes, differences in the extent to which girls and boys attribute characteristics such as brilliance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bian et al., 2017)</ref> or competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, &amp; Xu, 2002)</ref> to themselves and others could result in girls requesting less than boys in a negotiation context.</s><s>Importantly, these are not competing hypotheses but, rather, two avenues that could independently or jointly <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bussey &amp; Bandura, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Liben et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Neff et al., 2007)</ref> contribute to the gender negotiation gap.</s><s>Determining the precise mechanisms that explain our pattern of results is critical for designing interventions to minimize the emergence of gender differences in negotiation starting from elementary school when they first emerge and extending into adulthood.</s></p><p><s>Although this study is an exciting first step in understanding the origins of the gender gap in negotiation, we must of course be cautious when attributing our effects to evaluator gender specifically because there was only one male and one female evaluator.</s><s>It is possible that it was something about these two evaluators that drove these effects besides their gender.</s><s>Despite this limitation, we believe our results remain compelling for two reasons.</s><s>First, children's gender differences in negotiation emerged with age, suggesting that our male evaluator did not treat boys and girls differently on the whole.</s><s>Second, even if it were the case that these differences were specifically due to the individual evaluators rather than their gender, our broader result would stand: Girls, but not boys, show sensitivity to external factors when negotiating, and this sensitivity emerges surprisingly early in development.</s><s>It is possible that girls perceived the male evaluator differently with agefor example, as colder <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Eckes, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fiske et al., 2002)</ref> or higher status <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Liben et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Neff et al., 2007)</ref>and adjusted their behavior accordingly.</s><s>We believe that these data open up exciting avenues for future work that is needed to understand the precise mechanisms driving our findings.</s></p><p><s>Much attention has been devoted to explaining and closing the gender pay gap, yet these efforts focus almost exclusively on adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bowles &amp; Babcock, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Our findings suggest that these efforts should start earlier in development, as early as elementary school.</s></p></div>
