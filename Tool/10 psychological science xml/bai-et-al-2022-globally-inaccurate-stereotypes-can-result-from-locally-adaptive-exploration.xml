<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p><s>Procedure.</s><s>Despite statistically significant and large effect-size differences between the self-select and randommeet conditions in Experiment 1, the precise mechanism underlying these differences was unclear.</s><s>In Experiment 2, we investigated two possible mechanisms behind the differences between the self-select and the random-meet conditions: (a) active versus passive learning and (b) exposure to choices versus rewards.</s></p><p><s>First, we explored the role of active versus passive learning.</s><s>Do the selective samples make participants biased, or does the sense of control make them biased?</s><s>To address this confound, we added a between-subject yoked design.</s><s>In the yoke-both condition, participants did not have a chance to select partners but could view only partners selected for them (like the random-meet condition).</s><s>However, the choices were not randomly drawn from a uniform distribution (unlike the randommeet condition) but were paired from other participants' responses from the self-select condition (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Markant &amp; Gureckis, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Prager et al., 2018)</ref>.</s><s>Our theoretical model would not predict a difference between the two conditions, but active-learning theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bruner, 1961)</ref> suggest a difference.</s></p><p><s>Second, we explored the role of choice exposure and reward exposure.</s><s>Are the rewards attached to each choice important for the estimations, or is the mere presence of choices sufficient for biased impressions?</s><s>To address this, we added another between-subject yoked condition.</s><s>Participants could either encounter the choices and the rewards in the exact sequence (i.e., yoke both), or they could encounter the choices in the same order but the rewards in randomized order (i.e., yoke choice only).</s><s>Our model predicted that reward order matters, given the sequential feedback of this decision process.</s><s>Any perturbation of the reward order should then lead participants to form less biased impressions than the exact order (see model details in Section S3.2 in the Supplemental Material), but the mere-exposure hypothesis suggests little difference <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Zajonc, 1968)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Therefore, Experiment 2 tested four sampling strategies-(a) self-select, (b) yoke-both, (c) yoke-choiceonly, and (d) random-meet-with the same game using identical-reward and no-prior designs.</s><s>We predicted that participants in the self-select, yoke-both, and yokechoice-only conditions would have a lower Herfindahl score in partner choices and a larger standard deviation in reward estimations than participants in the randommeet condition.</s><s>Moreover, we predicted that participants in the yoke-both condition would behave similarly to participants in the self-select condition.</s><s>Finally, we predicted that participants in the yoke-choice-only condition would be less biased than participants in the yoke-both condition.</s><s>In other words, we expected to see graded standard deviations of the estimated rewards and for the self-select condition to show the biggest effects and the random-meet condition to show the smallest effects.</s><s>The hypothesis would fail if there were no estimated differences between conditions (see Sections S2.1, S2.2, and S3.2 in the Supplemental Material).</s></p><p><s>Participants.</s><s>Following a power analysis with pilot data including the two yoked designs (see details in Section S3.2), we recruited 2,005 online workers via Amazon Mechanical Turk's CloudResearch high-quality pool.</s><s>Our Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>As predicted, and replicating the findings of Experiment 1, results for Experiment 2 showed that participants with a self-select strategy (i.e., in the yoke-both and yokechoice-only conditions) were more likely to have lower Herfindahl scores on partner choices than participants with a random-meet strategy-b = -0.163,</s><s>95% CI = [-0.189,</s><s>-0.138], p &lt; .001;</s><s>random-meet strategy: m = .75,</s><s>d = 0, n = 502; self-select strategy: m =.57, d = .24,</s><s>n = 502, Cohen's d = 1.06.</s><s>This indicates that they interacted more selectively.</s><s>For number of interactions, participants in the random-meet condition interacted 10 times with each group, yet participants with a self-select strategy (i.e., in the yoke-both and yoke-choice-only condition) interacted 20, 10, 8, and 6 times on average with the perceived best, second, third, and worst group, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Also as predicted and replicating the findings of Experiment 1, results for Experiment 2 showed that participants with a self-select strategy were more likely to show a larger standard deviation of the estimated rewards than participants with a random-meet strategy  <ref type="bibr">[2.658, 5.196]</ref>, p &lt; .001;</s><s>m = 12.75, d = 10.19,</s><s>n = 501, Cohen's d = 0.43) also had a larger standard deviation than those with a random-meet strategy.</s><s>In terms of concrete estimations, participants with a random-meet strategy estimated the rewards to be on average 90, 84, 77, and 68 points (out of 100) in Groups 1 through 4, respectively.</s><s>In contrast, participants with a self-select strategy estimated the rewards to be 84, 72, 62, and 52 points (Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Unexpectedly, passive learning exacerbated bias (Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>): Participants in the yoke-both condition estimated the rewards to be on average 89, 75, 65, and 54 in Groups 1 through 4, which shows a larger standard deviation than for the self-select participants (b = 1.351, 95% CI = [0.081,</s><s>2.621], p = .037).</s><s>Our model did not predict a difference, and active-learning research would predict the opposite.</s><s>We speculate that the underestimation of the best group in the self-select condition may have contributed to this empirical finding.</s></p><p><s>Finally, as expected, reward exposure matters (Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>): Participants in the yoke-choice-only condition estimated the rewards to be on average 91, 79, 70, and 59 in Groups 1 through 4, which is a smaller standard deviation than estimated by the participants in the yoke-both condition (b = -1.537,</s><s>95% CI = [-2.807,</s><s>-0.266], p = .018).</s><s>This is consistent with our model and simulation: When the sequence of the rewards was disturbed, estimation would be disturbed as well (in the Supplemental Material, see analysis details in Section S4.2-3 and an exploratory analysis with warmth and competence perceptions in Section S4.2-4).</s></p><p><s>Also replicating the findings of Experiment 1, an individual-level analysis revealed that the more a participant interacted with one group predominantly, the more likely it was that the participant estimated a larger group difference in level of reward-Pearson's r(2003) = -.397,</s><s>p &lt; .001.</s></p><p><s>In sum, a replication with higher statistical power confirmed that participants may have engaged in locally adaptive exploration when exploring a fictional city.</s><s>As a result, they formed inaccurate impressions by perceiving differences between groups when in reality there were no group-level differences.</s><s>The selective samples (rather than the sense of control) and the exposure to rewards (rather than the mere presence of choices) might be key mechanisms that contribute to this phenomenon.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Adaptive exploration strategies-in an environment with no differences among groups-suffice to generate inaccurate stereotypes.</s><s>We offer a plausible, minimal, sufficient means by which stereotypes can develop.</s><s>Without demonstrated motivations (from social identity, dominance, or threat), cognitive limitations (from selective attention or prior biases), or information deficits (from majority or minority representation), adaptive exploration produces a local impression good enough for present purposes but ignorant of other, foregone possibilities.</s><s>This process is functional: Adaptive exploration maximizes utility in particular social environments without prolonging search.</s><s>However, this otherwise functional approach may cause collateral damage (e.g., inaccurate stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination) to the unexplored groups.</s><s>This minimal functional paradigm plausibly fits the simulation, the human data, and common sense.</s></p><p><s>This theoretically clean and precisely defined paradigm can guide research on why people form biases.</s><s>For example, biased impressions may start even before people develop prejudices (e.g., right-wing authoritarianism, social-dominance orientation), endorse malicious motivations (e.g., active oppression, resource control), experience cognitive limitations (e.g., cognitive miser, attentional shifts), or encounter information deficits  <ref type="figure">4</ref>. Empirical results from the "Explore Toma City" game in Experiment 2. The graphs in (a) display the frequency with which participants chose each of the four groups, separately for the self-select, yoke-both, yoke-choice-only, and random-meet conditions.</s><s>The graph in (b) displays estimated reward probability in the final round of the four conditions, separately for each of the four groups.</s><s>Groups are ordered by frequency of interaction prior to averaging.</s><s>In (b), raw data is shown in the background.</s><s>Group 1 is the group selected most often by each participant.</s><s>The dashed vertical line represents the ground truth.</s><s>In all graphs, error bars represent bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals.</s><s>(For more analyses, see Section S4.2 in the Supplemental Material.)</s><s>(e.g., group-size differences).</s><s>There are two minimal conditions sufficient for biased impressions to emerge: All groups in the environment are equally likely to result in a successful interaction, and decision-makers make adaptive choices about those interactions.</s></p><p><s>Of course, people with prior prejudices, malicious motivations, higher cognitive loads, selective attention, or lower accessibility to one group should be even more, not less, likely to form inaccurate impressions.</s><s>Research should test how these factors interact with our basic paradigm.</s><s>For example, researchers investigating illusory correlation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hamilton &amp; Gifford, 1976</ref>; J. W. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Sherman et al., 2009)</ref> have assumed asymmetric group sizes.</s><s>Our paradigm relaxes that assumption; even if groups are equal in size, illusory correlations can still emerge as a result of exploratory sampling.</s></p><p><s>Further insight comes from the observation that both our model and human participants were more likely to form accurate impressions when the underlying rewards were different.</s><s>This does not necessarily mean that people will never form inaccurate impressions given real group differences.</s><s>First, the impressions about the least interacted groups were always inaccurate.</s><s>Second, other mechanisms such as motivational biases and cognitive limitations can still play an important role in those situations.</s><s>Future work could test more complex combinations.</s></p><p><s>Another connection is ratio bias-that is, people amplifying proportional trends in large samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Fiedler et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Because the true proportion of rewarding interactions for each group was high in our study, we actually saw the opposite: Proportional trends are reduced in smaller samples.</s><s>Future work should explore changes in sample size to enrich the current paradigm.</s></p><p><s>In addition, future experiments should examine behaviors among participants who do not speak English or who do not work online.</s></p><p><s>Stereotypes have been described as overgeneralizing some kernel of truth <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Allport, 1954)</ref>.</s><s>Implicit in that definition is the mean difference between groups.</s><s>However, our work suggests another possibility: Stereotypes may simply be an accumulation of arbitrary things not based on any truth.</s><s>In both simulations and experiments, the group with whom the agents interacted the most, and thus estimated the most accurately, was completely arbitrary.</s><s>It depended on the initial interactions, which by construction were random.</s><s>However, this limited our analysis to individual-level stereotypes, which differ from collective stereotypes on which society has consensus.</s><s>Future work could include contextual bandits to examine whether people learn mappings between features that make them more likely to generalize certain stereotypes to certain groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Schulz et al., 2018)</ref>.</s><s>Transmission of information between agents and across generations could be another mechanism of acquiring collective stereotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Martin et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Stereotypes about social groups are not unidimensional.</s><s>Future work could test how this paradigm applies to the emergence of complex stereotype contents, such as warmth/communion and competence/ agency <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abele et al., 2021)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Understanding the origin of inaccurate stereotypes as one consequence of locally adaptive exploration provides new theoretical and pragmatic insights.</s><s>Theoretically, our paradigm pays homage to <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Tajfel et al's (1971)</ref> minimal-group paradigm, identifying minimal conditions for stereotypes to emerge.</s><s>We predict that stereotypes can result from an adaptive solution to a particularly challenging environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Anderson, 1991)</ref>.</s><s>The environment is challenging exactly because social groups can be equally rewarding, so people have multiple ways to maximize long-term rewards from interactions.</s><s>This goal is at odds with another goal: forming accurate impressions.</s><s>In seeking to maximize rewards, people are driven to strategies that explore only locally-focusing on options already considered-and it is this adaptive exploration that leads to inaccurate impressions.</s><s>This perspective is intended not to justify stereotypes but rather to demonstrate an even harder, seemingly innocent, but almost unavoidable route for biases to emerge.</s><s>This perspective also encourages researchers to think about how to better modify the social environment and exploration strategies to reduce inaccurate stereotypes.</s></p><p><s>Pragmatically, our paradigm predicts that even if one could address the subpopulation that has malicious intentions or cognitive limitations or even if the environment were to equip people with equal information about all groups, social psychologists should not expect inaccurate stereotypes to naturally disappear.</s><s>To reduce inaccurate stereotypes, we should first intervene at the environmental level.</s><s>For example, participants with a random-meet strategy were exposed to diverse representations of Toma people, so they formed less biased impressions compared with those in the self-select condition who were predominantly exposed to one group.</s><s>Correlational studies show consistent evidence that representational diversity reduces perceived differences among groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bai et al., 2020)</ref>, but more natural experiments are needed to test this hypothesis.</s></p><p><s>Our analyses also predict a role for strategies that encourage exploration of the environment.</s><s>Even when the underlying population in a place is diverse, if people just explore on the basis of their past experiences, they will be more likely to behave as our self-select participants did, without noticing that other groups can be equally good.</s><s>Hence, interventions that motivate exploration could combat that all-too-human tendency.</s><s>From this perspective, the intergroup-contact hypothesis may fulfill this cognitive mechanism by encouraging people to interact more with out-group members in a variety of ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Allport, 1954)</ref>.</s><s>Again, more direct experiments and measures are needed to test this hypothesis.</s></p><p><s>Drawing on theoretical analysis, simulations, and empirical data, we propose that inaccurate stereotypes can result from locally adaptive exploration.</s><s>Rather than rebut prior explanations, we provide a complementary perspective, a process that is general and deep, independent of group motives, cognitive limits, or information constraints.</s><s>Perhaps one origin of stereotypes is much simpler than has been thought; even minimal process assumptions can recreate it.</s><s>However, this simplicity is also troubling: If stereotypes can result from each person pursuing their own self-interest, we may need to work harder to create environments in which problematic stereotypes do not develop.</s></p></div>
