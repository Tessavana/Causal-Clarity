<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjects</head><p><s>We tested 21 dogs, three of which were excluded from the study because of experimenter error.</s><s>This resulted in a final sample size of 18 dogs (11 females; age: M = 4.6 years, SD = 1.9; see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> for subject information).</s><s>We used a Bayesian stopping rule to determine our sample size.</s><s>We included dogs until we reached a Bayes factor (BF) greater than 3 or less than 0.33 <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Wagenmakers et al., 2018)</ref>, had tested at least 10 dogs, and had fully counterbalanced trial orders across subjects.</s><s>All dogs were family pets recruited through an online survey and were brought in for testing sessions at the Clever Canine Lab, which is based at The University of Auckland.</s><s>Subjects could participate in the study if they (a) had been in the owner's household for a minimum of 6 months; (b) were not aggressive toward other dogs; (c) had never seen large, realistic-looking fake dogs at home; and (d) showed no signs of discomfort when attached to a tethered leash by an experimenter.</s><s>These criteria ensured that subjects were likely bonded to their owner, were comfortable with the experimental setup, and would not pull toward a large, realisticlooking fake dog because of fear or aggression.</s><s>Owners were not told the purpose of the study until all trials were concluded.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental setup</head><p><s>At the start of each trial, dogs were taken into a small room (3.6 m × 3.4 m) by an experimenter.</s><s>They were held in the room until the trial had been set up in the main testing area.</s><s>The dog's peak pulling force (N) across each 30-s trial was measured using a WSDFG50K force gauge (Wedderburn, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia).</s></p><p><s>For each trial, the dog was centrally positioned 5 m away from a large barrier (2.90 m × 0.86 m), and a smaller barrier (0.86 m × 1.2 m) was placed 1.5 m to one side of the large barrier.</s><s>The location of the small barrier (to the right or to the left of the large barrier) was randomized across subjects.</s><s>Photographs of both barriers are provided in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>.</s><s>Throughout all trials, the owner sat in a chair placed centrally behind the large barrier.</s><s>Owners wore opaque goggles and noisecanceling headphones playing white noise throughout each trial.</s><s>The large barrier was equipped with wheels and could be slid to reveal the owner behind it and any objects placed beside the owner.</s><s>The small barrier was lifted and removed at the start of each trial and replaced at the end of each trial.</s></p><p><s>When designing our study, we took past research in this area into account.</s><s>We used large, realistic-looking fake dogs with fur-like texture, unlike some past studies (Prato-Previde, Nicotra, Pelosi, &amp; Valsecchi, 2018), in which models were made from plastic or had unusual proportions.</s><s>We also used a greater distance, presenting the fake realistic-looking dogs 5 m away.</s><s>There is evidence in the literature that large plastic models are convincing at a distance of 3 m <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Barnard et al., 2012)</ref>, suggesting that a realistic fake dog could be mistaken for a real social rival at a distance of 5 m.</s><s>Fake dogs with fur-like texture, such as the ones used in our study, appear to be more convincing than plastic models.</s><s>Shelter dogs react similarly to real dogs and stuffed toy fake dogs at a distance of 1 m, and stuffed toy fake dogs can elicit normal responses from real dogs in a playful context <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Leaver &amp; Reimchen, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>We opted to use a fake dog to ensure that olfactory, auditory, and visual cues remained as similar as possible across conditions.</s><s>A real dog may have reacted to being spoken to by wagging its tail, creating a potential confounding factor (air movement or sound) that could have led subjects to react differently in the two conditions.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p><s>All subjects experienced two test conditions, the dog condition and the cylinder condition, presented in a counterbalanced order across subjects.</s><s>Dogs were first habituated to the force gauge and to the sight of their owners wearing goggles and headphones during a brief interaction prior to the first trial.</s></p><p><s>In the dog condition, owners first sat behind the large barrier.</s><s>Experimenter 1 then placed a large, realisticlooking fake dog (60 cm × 22 cm × 60 cm) that resembled an American Foxhound next to them.</s><s>The position of the fake dog (to the left or to the right of the owner) was randomized across subjects.</s><s>A fleece cylinder was positioned in front of the barrier on the opposite side from the fake dog.</s><s>After these objects were set up, Experimenter 2 (hereafter, referred to as the handler) brought the subject out of the small room and tethered it to a metal door frame by a leash.</s><s>This leash was attached to the force gauge.</s><s>Experimenter 1 then walked across the room to move the small barrier to one side of the large barrier.</s><s>There were no objects behind the small barrier to reveal in this condition.</s><s>Experimenter 1 then walked over to the large barrier and slid it across to reveal the fake dog sitting next to the owner while the owner faced straight ahead.</s><s>The barrier was kept open for 5 s.</s><s>If the dog looked away from the barrier during that time, the handler alerted Experimenter 1, who tapped the barrier to call the dog's attention.</s><s>The dog was then given 5 s to view the fake dog (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The barrier was then closed again, concealing the fake dog.</s><s>Experimenter 1 then opened a small fleece-covered shelf beside the owner, quietly tipped the fake dog over, and placed the shelf in the same location where the fake dog had originally stood.</s><s>The owner was tapped on the shoulder as a signal to initiate petting and talking to the shelf as if it were a real dog.</s><s>The use of the shelf ensured that the owner was provided with no tactile information about the dog that they were supposedly petting, ensuring that the owner could not provide unconscious cues to the dog on how to react to the interaction.</s><s>Therefore, from the subjects' perspectives, their owners appeared to be petting the previously seen fake dog, but the owners themselves were blind to experimental conditions.</s><s>At the end of 30 s, the experimenter tapped the owner on the shoulder again.</s><s>The owner then stopped the interaction, faced forward again, and placed their hands on their lap.</s><s>The handler obtained the peak pulling force from the force gauge and then took the subject back into the small room.</s></p><p><s>The second test condition (the cylinder condition) was identical to the dog condition, but this time, the realistic-looking fake dog was placed behind the small barrier at a distance of 1.5 m away from the large barrier and facing the owner.</s><s>It was therefore made visible for the full duration of the trial, unlike in the dog condition, where it remained hidden behind the large barrier.</s><s>Instead of petting and speaking to the shelf behind the barrier, owners were now instructed to pet and speak to a fleece cylinder (22 cm × 22 cm × 60 cm) placed in front of the barrier.</s><s>Owners were asked to speak to the fleece cylinder as if it were a real dog.</s><s>However, the cylinder remained static and visible to the subjects to ensure that it was perceived as an inanimate object.</s></p><p><s>Regardless of whether they were interacting with the fake dog or the cylinder, owners were instructed not to say their dogs' names, any names of dogs they might know, training commands, or words that might cause their dog to get excited (e.g., "treats," "balls," "walkies").</s><s>Instead, owners repeated a few generic phrases (e.g., "What a good boy!" "You are such a good dog!" "What a clever girl!") several times for the duration of the trial.</s><s>Owners rehearsed each condition while their dog was kept in a soundproof corridor before the start of each test trial.</s></p><p><s>Following the two test conditions, dogs experienced a final confirmation trial, which served as a manipulation check for our mentally represented interaction in the dog condition.</s><s>It ensured that we were testing dogs who reacted to a visible jealousy-inducing condition, that is, they would pull at least 10 N over the course of 30 s while watching a directly observable jealousyinducing interaction.</s><s>In this trial, the experimenter slid the large barrier to reveal a fake dog behind it.</s><s>Subjects then directly observed their owners, now not wearing headphones or goggles, petting and speaking to a realisticlooking fake dog for 30 s.</s><s>One of two different fake dogs, resembling either a Doberman Pinscher or a German Shepherd Dog, both measuring 55 cm × 18 cm × 50 cm, was used in this interaction (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>New fake dogs were used in this trial in case subjects had realized by then that the previously encountered fake dog was not a real social rival, as it remained motionless for the duration of both test trials.</s><s>The fake dogs used were randomly assigned and counterbalanced across subjects, unless owners mentioned that their dogs had had a negative experience with either breed, in which case the other one was used in the final trial.</s><s>This reduced the risk of subjects' individual experiences affecting their pulling force in the confirmation trial for reasons unrelated to jealous behavior.</s><s>All tested dogs pulled at or above 10 N in this final trial (M = 112.15</s><s>N, 95% credible interval = [51.17,</s><s>173.13]); therefore, no subject was excluded from our analyses because it did not react appropriately when it could visibly see its owner petting a fake dog.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analyses</head><p><s>We used the subject's peak pulling force by the end of each 30-s trial as a proxy for dogs' desire to approach their owner in each of the three trials.</s><s>We predicted that if dogs showed signs of jealous behavior only when their owners interacted with a social rival, they should pull harder in the dog condition than in the cylinder condition.</s><s>The two conditions were compared using a Bayesian paired-samples t test.</s><s>The prior distribution used for the alternative hypothesis was a half-Cauchy distribution (r = .707)</s><s>centered on an effect size of 0.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>In the dog condition, subjects first observed their owner sitting next to a realistic-looking fake dog.</s><s>The fake dog was then occluded by a barrier, and the owner petted and spoke to a fleece-covered shelf behind the barrier while a fleece cylinder remained in full view of the subject.</s><s>In the cylinder condition, the owner petted and spoke to a visible fleece cylinder of approximately the same texture and size as the fake dog while the fake dog remained in full view of the subject.</s><s>The order of the dog condition and cylinder condition was counterbalanced across subjects.</s><s>In both conditions, we measured subjects' desire to approach the scene by recording their peak pulling force over a 30-s interaction, that is, the hardest pull recorded over the course of the 30 s.</s><s>We predicted that if dogs showed all three signatures of jealous behavior, they would pull harder in the dog condition than in the cylinder condition.</s></p><p><s>Dogs' average peak pulling force in the dog condition was 158.03 N (95% credible interval = [66.79,</s><s>249.27]), whereas in the cylinder condition, it was 73.51 N (95% credible interval <ref type="bibr">= [36.65, 110.37]</ref>).</s><s>Dogs pulled significantly harder in the dog condition than in the cylinder condition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>; Bayesian paired-samples t test: BF = 4.438 ± &lt; 0.01% error).</s></p><p><s>We compared dogs' pulling force in our final confirmation trial, designed as a manipulation check, with their pulling force in the dog condition to exclude two potential alternative hypotheses.</s><s>Dogs might have pulled more strongly in the dog condition than in the cylinder condition because they were attempting to gain visual access to the interaction (the visual-access hypothesis).</s><s>Alternatively, they might have pulled less strongly in the cylinder condition than in the dog condition because the social rival, being fully visible, was more distracting and so elicited less pulling in the cylinder condition (the distraction hypothesis).</s><s>Both these alternative hypotheses predict that dogs should have pulled harder in the dog condition, in which the fake dog was behind a barrier, than in the confirmation trial, in which the fake dog was fully visible.</s><s>A Bayesian paired-samples t test revealed substantial evidence that there was no difference between the two conditions (BF = 0.121 ± &lt; 0.01% error), suggesting that dogs were not simply seeking to gain visual access to a hidden interaction in the dog condition and that they were not more distracted when the fake dog was fully visible in the cylinder condition.</s><s>This test supports our hypothesis that dogs' pattern of behavior was consistent with jealous behavior and not a consequence of either of these alternative hypotheses.</s></p><p><s>We also gathered video data from 15 subjects after the confirmation trial.</s><s>This allowed us to test whether subjects perceived the fake dog as a real conspecific, in which case we expected to see conspecific-directed behaviors after reaching the fake dog.</s><s>We coded these videos for anogenital and facial sniffing.</s><s>Fourteen out of 15 subjects (93.3% of dogs) performed conspecificdirected sniffing behaviors.</s><s>These behaviors suggest that subjects perceived the fake dogs as real throughout the study.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Our study shows that dogs pulled harder toward their owners when their owners appeared to interact with an out-of-sight fake dog than with a fleece cylinder.</s><s>This occurred despite both the fake dog and fleece cylinder being present in both of these conditions and owners being blind to the object they were petting and speaking to.</s><s>These results provide evidence that dogs show three signatures of human jealous behavior: (a) Jealous behavior emerged in response to a social partner attending to a social rival but not to a nonsocial object, (b) it emerged specifically in response to this interaction and not merely because of the presence of a conspecific, and (c) it emerged even though the interaction itself took place outside of the subject's view.</s><s>These results provide strong support for past research <ref type="bibr">(Abdai et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cook et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Harris &amp;

Smith, 1993)</ref>.</s><s>Our study excludes envious behavior as a possible alternative explanation by providing the same social resources (the owner's attention) to a social rival in the dog condition and to a nonsocial object in the cylinder condition.</s><s>Had dogs simply desired the social resource of their owner's attention, they should have pulled just as strongly in the control cylinder condition as they did when their owner directed that attention toward a perceived social rival in the test condition (dog condition).</s><s>However, dogs pulled more strongly in the dog condition than they did in the cylinder condition, indicating that the reason for this behavior was that their owner's attention was directed toward a social rival-and not the lack of attention in and of itself.</s></p><p><s>These findings also suggest that dogs may display more than a form of proto-jealousy, as has been suggested in the past <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Harris &amp;

Call, 2011)</ref>, this ability has never been extended to mental representations of jealousy-inducing social interactions.</s><s>In fact, this human signature of jealousy has, to date, been demonstrated only in adult humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Buss et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Harris, 2000)</ref> and has been claimed to be unique to our species <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Leary, 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Dogs' ability to "connect the dots" and infer that their owners' actions were directed toward a hidden rival suggests that dogs not only are capable of mentally representing social interactions but also specifically do so when interpreting interactions that might threaten the social bond they have with their owners.</s><s>This has implications above and beyond the similarities between jealous behavior in dogs and jealousy in adult humans.</s><s>Our study provides evidence that dogs can mentally represent social interactions, which in itself is a complex cognitive ability.</s><s>This finding therefore raises the question of how widely dogs might use mental representation when thinking about the world around them.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Darwin (1871</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Darwin ( /2004</ref>) was one of the first researchers to suggest that dogs show jealous behavior, stating that "everyone has seen how jealous a dog is of his master's affection, if lavished on any other creature" (p.</s><s>92).</s><s>The results here, in showing that dogs display three human signatures of jealous behavior, provide strong support both for this statement and for claims in more recent research that dogs differentiate between jealousy-inducing and nonjealousy-inducing interactions <ref type="bibr">(Abdai et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cook et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Harris, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Prato-Previde, Nicotra, Fusar Poli, et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Prato-Previde, Nicotra, Pelosi, &amp;
